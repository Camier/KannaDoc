The rationale for the development of this drug class stems from our understanding of the role of PDE4 in suppressing the function of a range of inflammatory and resident cells thought to contribute toward the pathogenesis of these diseases. Similarly, numerous preclinical <i>in vivo</i> studies have shown that PDE4 inhibitors suppress characteristic features of these diseases, namely, cell recruitment, activation of inflammatory cells and physiological changes in lung function in response to a range of insults to the airways. These potentially beneficial actions of PDE4 inhibitors have been successfully translated in phase II and III clinical trials with roflumilast and cilomilast. However, dose limiting side effects of nausea, diarrhoea and headache have tempered the enthusiasm of this drug class for the treatment of these respiratory diseases.

However, none of these events appear to be realized in phase II and phase III clinical trials undertaken with cilomilast and roflumilast.

It has been suggested that PDE4 inhibitors may have proinflammatory properties (<a href=\"#block-7-0\">McCluskie <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a>). This conclusion was based on the finding that roflumilast at very high doses (100 mg/kg) promoted the recruitment of neutrophils to the airways and this correlated with the release of interleukin-8 from cultured endothelial cells <i>in vitro</i>, although the concentrations required to achieve these effects were at least 1000 times greater than the ED<sub>50</sub> and EC<sub>50</sub> values reported for roflumilast against several <i>in vivo</i> biomarkers of inflammation and cell function <i>in vitro</i>, respectively (<a href=\"#block-6-0\">Bundschuh <i>et al.</i>,</a> <a href=\"#block-6-0\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#block-6-0\">Hatzelmann and Schudt, 2001)</a>.

Strategies at improving the risk to benefit ratio will be important, if this drug class is to be widely used. The therapeutic window for anti-inflammatory action of these drugs and side effects such as nausea and emesis is probably not wide enough for cilomilast, and may limit the use of roflumilast in asthma. There are PDE4 inhibitors currently in development, which appear to lack significant emetic action (for example, oglemilast) <a href=\"#block-6-0\">(Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, 2005)</a> and IPL512602 <a href=\"#block-6-0\">(Inflazyme pharmaceuticals, 2005</a>), although the molecular basis for this has not been published.</p>\n", "page": 5, "polygon": [[128.0, 446.0], [776.0, 446.0], [776.0, 866.0], [128.0, 866.0]], "bbox": [128.0, 446.0, 776.0, 866.0], "section_hierarchy": {"2": "/page/5/SectionHeader/4"}, "images": {}, "chunk_id": 78}

Nonetheless, the development of a potent, long acting PDE4 inhibitor through the inhaled route would offer a solution to the issues of emesis and nausea. Another approach might be the use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting PDE4, which could be delivered by the inhaled route, and in view of the positive results obtained in the successful targeting of the adenosine A1 receptor in a rabbit model of allergic inflammation (Nye <a href=\"#block-7-0\">and Metzger, 1997</a>), illustrates the potential of this approach.</p>\n", "page": 5, "polygon": [[128.0, 864.0], [776.0, 864.0], [776.0, 1372.0], [128.0, 1372.0]], "bbox": [128.0, 864.0, 776.0, 1372.0], "section_hierarchy": {"2": "/page/5/SectionHeader/4"}, "images": {}, "chunk_id": 79}
{"id": "/page/5/Text/7", "block_type": "Text", "html": "\n<p>Another reason why targeting PDE4 alone may not fully resolve airway inflammation is the fact that other PDE types exist in structural and inflammatory cells in the lung (<a href=\"#block-1-0\">Table 1</a>) and therefore, targeting multiple PDE enzymes may be required for optimal anti-inflammatory action. For example, the macrophage is viewed as a critical cell type in the pathogenesis of COPD (Barnes, 2006b); however, the activity of these cells is only inhibited to a small degree by PDE4 inhibitors (<a href=\"#block-6-0\">Hatzelmann and Schudt, 2001)</a> and the potential functional involvement of PDE3 and PDE7 in these cells cannot be completely ignored. The inhibitory action of PDE4 inhibitors on the cellular activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and macrophages was significantly increased in the presence of PDE7 selective inhibitors (<a href=\"#block-7-0\">Smith <i>et al.</i>,</a> <a href=\"#block-7-0\">2004</a>). Similarly, combined PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitor in a single molecule offers the advantage of delivering a bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory substance.
