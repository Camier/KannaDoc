   <p>
    A well-characterized standardized hydroethanolic extract of a traditionally recognized
    <i>
     mak
    </i>
    (mild) variety of
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    , a South African plant with a long history of traditional ingestion, is marketed under the trade name Zembrin® as an ingredient for use in functional foods and dietary supplements. It is standardized to contain 0.35–0.45% total alkaloids (mesembrenone and mesembrenol ≥60%, and mesembrine &lt;20%). A 14-day repeated oral toxicity study was conducted at 0, 250, 750, 2500, and 5000 mg/kg bw/day. A 90-day subchronic repeated oral toxicity study was conducted at 0, 100, 300, 450, and 600 mg/kg bw/day. Because
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    has a long history of human use for relieving stress and calming, a functional observation battery, including spontaneous locomotor activity measured using LabMaster ActiMot light-beam frames system, was employed. Several parameters, such as locomotion, rearing behavior, spatial parameters, and turning behavior were investigated in the final week of the study. No mortality or treatment-related adverse effects were observed in male or female Crl:(WI)BR Wistar rats in the 14- or 90-day studies. In the 14- and 90-day studies, the NOAELs were concluded as 5000 and 600 mg/kg bw/d, respectively, the highest dose groups tested.

    1. Introduction
   </h2>
   <p>
    The endemic South African succulent plant
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    (L.) N.E. Br. has an ancient oral history of use as a masticatory preparation and health tea by indigenous San and Khoi people. The first written record of the plant being used by indigenous people, accompanied by a painting of the plant, is from the year 1685
    <a href="#block-9-8">(Waterhouse et al., 1979)</a>
    . Tinctures (hydroethanolic extracts) of the plant were reported to be in common use by colonists of the Cape of Good Hope
    <a href="#block-9-6">(Pappe, 1868)</a>
    and can still be purchased from health shops, pharmacies, and farm stalls in South Africa. Packages of
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    tea bags, often in combination with Red Bush Tea (
    <i>
     Aspalathus linearis
    </i>
    ) or Honeybush tea (
    <i>
     Cyclopia spp.
    </i>
    ), are sold in supermarkets in South Africa. Over the last 15 years, increasing numbers of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    -based products, including teas, tinctures, tablets, capsules, and raw powdered plant material, often sold over
   </p>
   <p>
    the Internet, are being used by healthy individuals to promote a sense of well-being and to relieve stress
    <a href="#block-9-4">(Gericke and Viljoen, 2008)</a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    There has been considerable research on the chemistry of the alkaloids contained in the plant
    <a href="#block-9-4">(Gericke and Viljoen, 2008)</a>
    . A wide range of variation of the alkaloid chemistry in wild
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    plants has been described
    <a href="#block-9-8">(Shikanga et al., 2012)</a>
    , indicating the necessity of selecting naturally occurring and traditionally used plant chemotypes for commercial production and standardizing extracts of these plants to both the total alkaloid content and the alkaloid composition in order to have high quality commercial products. The four major
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    alkaloids (mesembrine, mesembrenone, mesembrenol, and mesembranol) have been shown in vitro to be permeable across porcine intestinal, sublingual, and buccal mucosa
    <a href="#block-9-8">(Shikanga et al., 2012)</a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    No formal toxicological studies have been previously published on
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    or on extracts of
    <i>
     S. tortuosum

    . Small-scale short-term studies in dogs and cats have been reported
    <a href="#block-9-4">(Hirabayashi</a>

    . The safety and tolerability variables studied were vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, laboratory assessments (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), and the recording of adverse events (AEs). There were no apparent differences in any of the safety and tolerability parameters studied, and both doses of the extract were well-tolerated.

    Historical use and emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that there is potential for the standardized extract of
    <i>
     S. tortuosum

    – Zembrin® – to be used in teas and as a dietary supplement to enhance and/or maintain health and wellness in healthy people wanting to feel calmer and under less stress.

    As a prelude to further development, the safety of Zembrin®, a well-characterized (see Table 1) extract of
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    standardized to contain 0.35–0.45% total alkaloids (mesembrenone and mesembrenol ≥60%, and mesembrine &lt;20%), has been formally studied in vivo in 14-day and 90-day repeated oral toxicity studies in rats, reported here for the first time.

    2. Materials and methods
   </h2>
   <h3>
    2.1. Test article
   </h3>
   <p>
    The test article was Zembrin® (manufactured by Polifenoles Naturales, SL, Pol. Ind. Las Majoreras, 35240 Ingenio, Las Palmas, Spain for HG&amp;H Pharmaceuticals (Pty) Ltd., The Braes, 193 Bryanston Drive, Bryanston 2191, South Africa), a proprietary standardized 2:1 hydroethanolic extract of the dried leaves and stems of
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    . Zembrin® was provided for use as the test article (batch numbers SCE0411-1605 and SCE0412-0901 for the 14- and 90-day studies, respectively), along with specifications, certificates of analysis, and material safety data sheets, by HG&amp;H Pharmaceuticals (Pty) Ltd. A brief description of Zembrin® and its manufacturing process is provided as follows:
   </p>
   <p>
    As declared by HG&amp;H Pharmaceuticals (Pty) Ltd, the source plant material was cultivated in South Africa. No phytochemicals were used during the production of
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    raw material for the production of Zembrin® and none were added during the manufacturing process. The production farms where the
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    source material for Zembrin® was grown are Global Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) certified. The use of pesticides in the cultivation of the
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    source material for Zembrin® was limited and restricted to the period of seed germination. During growth and after drying, samples of the harvested and dried plant source material were sent to internationally certified analytical laboratories to ensure conformity with international standards for pesticide residues, heavy metals, aflatoxins, and microbiology and exclusion of pathogenic bacteria, and the plant identity was confirmed by macroscopic characteristics, qualitative (GC-MS), and quantitative (HPLC) methods.
   </p>
   <p>
    The above ground parts were harvested, washed, and air-dried before sending to Polifenoles Naturales, SL (an EU-GMP certified manufacturer of plant extract) for extraction. The dried material was milled, extracted with water–ethanol (purified water 30% v/v and ethanol 70% v/v), filtered, distilled to remove residual solvent, and concentrated before spray drying onto a maltodextrin carrier that was adjusted to produce the specified standardization of alkaloids. After the extraction, concentration, and standardization processes, each lot (batch) of Zembrin® was tested

    2.2. Studies
   </h3>
   <p>
    The GLP animal studies reported below were conducted in compliance with internationally accepted guidelines: OECD 407 (14-day study)
    <a href="#block-9-5">(OECD, 2008)</a>
    and OECD 408 (90-day study)
    <a href="#block-9-5">(OECD, 1998)</a>
    and US FDA Redbook 2000, IV.C.3.a (14-day study)
    <a href="#block-9-4">(FDA, 2003a)</a>
    and IV.C.4.a (90-day study)
    <a href="#block-9-4">(FDA, 2003b)</a>
    . Care and use of study animals was in accordance with the National Research Council Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
    <a href="#block-9-4">(NRC, 2011)</a>
    and in compliance with the principles of the Hungarian Act 2011 CLVIII (modification of Hungarian Act 1998 XXVIII) regulating animal protection.
   </p>
   <p>
    Distilled water for parenteral administration was used as the control and the vehicle for administration of the test article. The test article doses were prepared by dissolving Zembrin® in distilled water to achieve concentrations of 25, 75, 250, and 500 mg/mL (14-day study) and 10, 30, 45, and 60 mg/mL (90-day study) to provide a constant dosing volume of 10 mL/kg bw. Doses were prepared daily, shortly before administration, during the 14-day study and either daily or within 7 days of administration during the 90-day study due to results of stability analysis indicating that Zembrin® is stable when dissolved in distilled water over a 10 day interval. The control group received the same volume of the vehicle only. The concentration, stability, and alkaloid concentration and composition of the dosing solutions was independently verified analytically prior to beginning the 14-day study, and concentrations of the dosing solutions were independently verified analytically twice during the 14-day study and three times during the 90-day study. Analysis of the test article was performed in a non-GLP academic analytical laboratory experienced in chromatographic quantitative analysis of mesembrine-alkaloids using validated analytical reference compounds.
   </p>
   <p>
    Specific pathogen-free (SPF) male and female Crl:(WI)BR Wistar rats (Toxi-Coop, Budapest, Hungary) were utilized in both studies. The animals were housed in individual type II polypropylene/polycarbonate cages with certified laboratory wood bedding (Lignocel®) (cages and bedding were changed once a week), at 22 ± 3 °C, 30–70% relative humidity, and a 12-hour light-dark cycle. The animals received snif® SM R/M-Z + H complete diet for rats and mice and potable tap water ad libitum. The health status of the animals was certified by the breeder, and a pre-experimental period (12-days, 14-day study/15-days, 90-day study) was provided to acclimatize the animals.
   </p>
   <h4>
    2.2.1. Fourteen-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study in rats
   </h4>
   <p>
    This dose range-finding study was carried out in order to evaluate repeated oral administration, over a 14-day period, of the test article in male and female rats for a broad range of doses in order to determine a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and to provide data for the selection of the dose groups for the 90-day repeated oral toxicity study.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fifty male and female SPF Wistar rats, approximately 7 weeks old and weighing 231–255 g (males) and 168–204 g (females) at the start of the experimental period, were stratified by weight and randomly assigned to five groups of five rats/sex/group for administration of Zembrin® doses of 0 (vehicle-control), 250, 750, 2500, and 5000 mg/kg bw/day by gavage for 14-days.

    After an overnight fast (approximately 16 hours) following final administration of the test article, blood samples were collected from the retro orbital venous plexus under Isofluran CP® anesthesia after which the animals were euthanized by exsanguination from the abdominal aorta. Blood samples were analyzed for hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters and gross pathological examinations and determinations of selected organ weights (absolute and relative) were conducted on all animals. Full histopathological examinations were conducted on the preserved organs and tissues of all animals of the control and high-dose groups. Histopathological examinations of kidneys, from some animals of the low- and middle-dose groups, in which lesions were observed on gross examination, were also conducted.

    2.2.2. Ninety-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study in rats
   </h4>
   <p>
    The study was conducted in order to evaluate the possible health hazards, including identification of toxic effects and target organs, of repeated oral exposure to Zembrin® in male and female rats over a 90-day period and to determine the NOAEL.
   </p>
   <p>
    One hundred SPF male and female Wistar rats, approximately 8 weeks old and weighing 264–316 g (males) and 171–220 g (females) at the start of the experimental period, were stratified by weight and randomly assigned to five groups of 10 rats/sex/group for administration of Zembrin® doses of 0 (vehicle-control), 100, 300, 450, and 600 mg/kg bw/day by gavage for 90-days. Dose selection was based on the previous results of the 14-day study with the lowest and highest doses corresponding to approximately 300- and 1800-fold, respectively, the proposed human use level of 25 mg daily (357 µg/kg in a 70 kg adult).
   </p>
   <p>
    The animals were observed twice daily for mortality. General cage-side observations for clinical signs were performed once daily after administration of the test article, and detailed clinical observations were performed 1 day prior to the first treatment and weekly thereafter. Measurements of body weight were conducted twice during the acclimation period, on the first experimental day prior to treatment, twice weekly during weeks 1–4, once a week during weeks 5–13, and immediately prior to sacrifice. Food intake was determined and food efficiency calculated once weekly. Ophthalmological examination was carried out on all animals prior to, and on control and high-dose animals at the end of, the experimental period.
   </p>
   <p>
    A functional observation battery performed during the final week assessed tests for general physical condition and behavior, sensory reactivity to stimuli, grip strength, and locomotor activity. Spontaneous locomotor activity was further assessed on one occasion during the final week using a LabMaster ActiMot light-beam frames system.
   </p>
   <p>
    The X, Y, and Z axis infrared (IR) sensor arrays of the ActiMot light-beam frames system monitored the activity of the animals in a 54 × 29 × 41 cm cage inserted inside
   </p>
   <p>
    the sensory frame. In the cage positioned into the frame, the X-axis represented length (54 cm), the Y-axis represented depth (29 cm), and the Z-axis represented height (41 cm). Within the ActiMot system frame, movement along the X-axis was monitored by 16 sensors (emitter and receiver pairs) installed along the long sides (54 cm) and movement along the Y-axis was monitored by eight sensors installed along the short sides (29 cm), respectively, of one flat frame. Movement along the Z-axis was monitored by 16 sensors installed along the long sides (54 cm) of a second flat frame parallel to and above the X/Y flat frame (i.e., the Z-axis sensor array was parallel to the X-axis sensor array and no sensors were installed in the short sides of the “Z level” frame). The position of the flat frame containing the “Z level” sensor array was vertically adjustable along the Z-axis by sliding up and down the four vertical corner frame posts of the system. The X- and Y-axis sensor arrays jointly monitored horizontal activity/movement, the Z-axis sensor array monitored vertical activity/movement, and computer software algorithms translated spatial temporal beam interruption patterns into animal activity patterns representing the evaluated parameters.
   </p>
   <p>
    Animals were examined individually, outside of their home cage environments, in the absence of any disturbing circumstances. The evaluated parameters were locomotion and activity (time resting in seconds, time moving in seconds, time hyperactive in seconds, distance travelled in meters, locomotor speed in cm/s, and overall speed in cm/s occurring in the central and peripheral areas and both areas combined), rearing behavior (time in rearing in seconds and the number of rearings in the center and peripheral areas; total rearing and time in rearing in seconds in both areas; and rearing time in seconds in corners 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the system), and turning behavior (both clockwise and counterclockwise in the central and peripheral areas and both areas combined).

Blood samples were analyzed for hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters, and gross pathological examinations and determinations of selected organ weights (absolute and relative) were conducted on all animals.

    2.3. Statistical analyses
   </h3>
   <p>
    Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS PC+ software, version 4 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Bartlett's homogeneity of variance test was used to assess heterogeneity of variance between groups. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted where no significant heterogeneity was detected followed by Duncan's Multiple Range test to assess the significance of inter-group differences if a positive ANOVA result was obtained. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was performed to examine

    3.1. Fourteen-day repeated oral toxicity study in rats
   </h3>
   <p>
    No mortality was observed in any of the dose groups during the 14-day treatment period. The animals exhibited normal behavior and physical condition with no significant abnormalities in clinical signs observed throughout the study. Slight to moderate or moderate transient salivation was observed immediately after administration of the test article in all high-dose group female animals, occurring with frequencies from five to nine observations per animal between days 6 and 14, in four of five high-dose group males, occurring with frequencies from five to nine observations per animal between days 5 and 13, and in one male in the 2500 mg/kg dose group on days 8 and 13. These findings were regarded as incidental and without toxicological significance because they were of low degree, transient in occurrence, and of short duration (ceasing within a few minutes after administration of the test article) and there were no other related findings. This presentation, occurring in only the two highest dose groups, is consistent with an etiology due to a physical or chemical feature of the test article, such as taste, although such properties of the test article were not assessed. Transient salivation is also historically observed in vehicle-treated animals. No test article-related effects on body weight or food consumption
    <a href="#block-2-0">(Table 2)</a>
    were observed during the study, and the mean weight, weight gain, food consumption, and food efficiency were similar between the control and treatment groups throughout the study. No eye lesions were observed on ophthalmologic examination in any animals before or after the treatment period.
   </p>
   <p>
    No remarkable alterations were observed in hematologic or clinical chemistry parameters. A small number of statistically significant differences between treated and control animals, observed among sexes
    <a href="#block-3-0">(Tables 3 and 4)</a>
    , were not considered to be test article-related or toxicologically meaningful because of low magnitude, single occurrence, no dose dependency, absence of related gross or histopathological findings, and because all observations remained within historical control ranges of the laboratory.
   </p>
   <p>
    On gross pathological examination, pyelectasia was observed in one male of the 750 mg/kg dose group and one male and one female of the 2500 mg/kg dose group. Renal paleness was observed in one male of the 2500 mg/kg dose group. A smaller than normal prostate was observed in one male (animal #2412) of the high-dose group, and slight or moderate hydrometria (indicative of the estrous cycle of the female animals) was observed in one to three females

    relative to brain weight in females of the low-dose group
    <a href="#block-4-0">(Table 6)</a>
    . Due to the lack of a dose-related effect, the small magnitude of the differences, and the lack of gross or histopathological lesions, these changes were considered to be without toxicological relevance and unrelated to test article administration.
   </p>
   <p>
    Histopathological examination
    <a href="#block-5-0">(Table 7)</a>
    revealed the presence of moderate subacute lymphocytic pyelitis, cystitis, and prostatitis in a single male animal (#2412) of the high-dose group. These observations were considered indicative of lymphocytic inflammation and were related to observations in this same animal of slightly (marginal to the historical range) increased neutrophil percentage (27.7 vs. 27.1%) and urea (11.93 vs. 11.75 mmol/L) compared to historical control ranges. The collective findings in animal #2412 were considered to be of no toxicological significance and unrelated to test article administration due to their occurrence as an individual disorder. This conclusion was supported, retrospectively, by the absence of similar findings in any animals of the 90-day study, herein also reported. Dilatation of uterine horns, indicating estrus phase of the sexual cycle and without associated pathological lesions, was observed in two of five females of the control group. No other histopathological lesions were observed in any organs or tissues of any animals in the control or high-dose groups. No histopathological findings were observed in the kidneys of a small number of animals in the middle dose groups where there were gross observations of species-specific alterations.

    No signs of toxicity that were considered related to administration of Zembrin® by gavage were observed in male or female CrI:(WI)BR Wistar rats at doses of 250, 750, 2500, or 5000 mg/kg bw/day for 14 consecutive days. The NOAEL was determined to be 5000 mg/kg bw/day.

   <h3>
    3.2. Ninety-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study in rats
   </h3>
   <p>
    No mortality was observed at any of the tested dose levels during the 90-day treatment period. The animals exhibited normal behavior and physical condition with no significant abnormalities in clinical signs observed throughout the study with one exception. During the final 2 weeks of the study, one male (animal #15) of the low dose group exhibited slightly decreased activity and slight dyspnea on days 74–77; moderately decreased activity, moderate dyspnea, and moderate piloerection on days 87–89; and slightly sanguineous nasal orifices on days 87 and 88. Because these observations were limited to only one animal in the low dose group, the observed signs were not considered to be of toxicological concern.
   </p>
   <p>
    No differences in behavior, sensory reactions to various types of stimuli, grip strength, or locomotor activity between treated animals and controls were observed during the functional observation battery. Observations of reduced righting reflex occurred with similar incidence in animals of all dose groups when compared to the control groups (greatest incidences occurred in the control groups). There were no significant differences in the ActiMot light-beam frame
   </p>
   <p>
    system measured parameters of spontaneous locomotor activity (locomotion, activity, spatial parameters, turning behavior, and rearing behavior) between the test article dose groups and control groups.
   </p>
   <p>
    No test article-related effects on body weight or food consumption were observed during the study (see
    <a href="#block-5-0">Table 8)</a>
    . A few statistically significant transient fluctuations in mean body weight gain observed among the sexes and dose groups were of low degree and not dose-dependent. Mean food consumption was slightly, but statistically significantly, lower in all treated male dose groups compared to controls during the first week of the study. The difference was transient and of low magnitude, unrelated to body weight or weight gain, and remained within the historical ranges of the laboratory. Therefore the finding was not considered to be of toxicological relevance. No eye lesions were observed on ophthalmologic examination in any animals before or after the treatment period.
   </p>
   <p>
    Statistically significant elevations in white blood cell count, reticulocyte count, and percentage of neutrophils together with a statistically significant decrease in percentage of lymphocytes were observed in a single male (animal #15) of the 100 mg/kg bw/day group (isolated clinical observations (reported above) and isolated gross pathological findings were observed in the same animal) and were considered indicative of an individual lesion unrelated to the test article. No other remarkable alterations were observed in hematologic or clinical chemistry parameters; however, slight but statistically significant differences in neutrophil percent (between females of the 100 and 600 mg/kg bw/day groups and controls) and various clinical chemistry parameters (between male and female animals of all dose groups and controls) were observed
    <a href="#block-5-0">(Tables 9</a>
    <a href="#block-5-0">and 10)</a>
    , but were not considered to be test article-related or toxicologically meaningful because of low magnitude, lack of dose-relationship, and absence of related pathological findings and because all observations remained within or marginal to historical control ranges of the laboratory.
   </p>
   <p>
    On gross examination, a blood filled thoracic formation was observed in one male (animal #15) of the low-dose group. Together with the white blood cell abnormalities and clinical observations observed in this animal, the finding is consistent with gavage irritation and, therefore, was not considered toxicologically relevant. Several other sporadic lesions were observed in male animals of the control group and all but the high-dose group of the treated animals on gross pathological examination (Table 11). These lesions were isolated to individual animals, were not dose related, and are common findings in untreated rats and were, therefore, not considered to be of toxicological concern or test article-related. Hydrometria, related to the sexual cycle and of no toxicological relevance, was observed in some females of the control group and all but the low dose group of treated animals (Table 11).
   </p>
   <p>
    The liver to body weight ratio of high dose males was slightly less compared to control males, and statistically significant differences in mean adrenal weight and adrenal to body weight ratio and mean heart to body weight ratio were observed in high-dose females

    Sporadic lesions upon histopathological examination
    <a href="#block-9-0">(Table 13)</a>
    were revealed with similar frequency in the control and high-dose group and were not considered treatment-related. Observed lesions were alveolar emphysema, considered a consequence of exsanguination; hyperplasia of bronchus associated lymphoid tissue, a physiological phenomenon; alveolar histiocytosis, a common incidental finding in older rats; and dilatation of the uterine horns, indicating estrus phase of the sexual cycle. Sporadic lesions observed in a single kidney of a 300 mg/kg dose group male, a cervical lymph node of a 450 mg/kg dose group male, and the testes of a control group male were considered unrelated to the test article due to the low frequency of their occurrence as isolated individual disorders in animals of the control and lower dose groups only and their common observation in untreated experimental rats of this strain with similar phase. No other microscopic lesions were observed in any organs or tissues of control or treated animals subjected to histopathological examination.

    No signs of toxicity that were considered related to administration of Zembrin® by gavage were observed in male or female Crl:(WI)BR Wistar rats at doses 100, 300, 450, and 600 mg/kg bw/day for 90 consecutive days. The NOAEL was determined to be 600 mg/kg bw/day.

    4. Discussion and conclusion
   </h2>
   <p>
    The present studies are the first formal
    <i>
     in vivo
    </i>
    toxicological studies of an extract of
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    (Zembrin®) and provide supporting evidence for the safety and tolerability findings in the first clinical study
    <a href="#block-9-4">(Nell et al., 2013)</a>
    . The repeated administration of Zembrin® for 90 days by gavage to Wistar rats resulted in a NOAEL of 600 mg/kg bw/day. Applying a 100-fold uncertainty factor to compensate for inter- and intraspecies differences, results can be extrapolated to an acceptable daily intake of 420 mg by a 70 kg human. Zembrin® is intended to be used as an ingredient in functional foods, beverages, and dietary supplements. The recommended consumption is 25 mg per day. This is 0.357 mg/kg bw/day in a 70 kg adult, which is 1680 times less than the NOAEL of 600 mg/kg bw/day. The indigenous classification as a
    <i>
     mak
    </i>
    , or mild variety, of the
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    variety selected for extraction of Zembrin® is supported by our findings that there were no changes in central nervous system signs, behavior, activity, weight, or food intake at any of the doses studied.
   </p>
   <p>
    In previous safety assessments (Harvey, 2008, unpublished; Jurkowski, 2008, unpublished), we observed that ≤100 µg/mL of Zembrin® had no effect on several mammalian cell lines and did not cause genotoxicity in vitro, as revealed by assays for induction of micronuclei in CHO-K1 and V79 cells, or bacterial reversion in an Ames test. At 10 µg/mL Zembrin® did partly reduce K

    currents through hERG channels in whole cell patch clamp experiments although this concentration is unlikely to be achieved
