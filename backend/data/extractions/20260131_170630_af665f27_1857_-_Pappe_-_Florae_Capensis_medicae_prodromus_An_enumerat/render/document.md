## PREFACE. ---

THE first edition of this little work appeared towards the close of 1850. It was intended as a commentary to a choice collection of Cape medical drugs, sent by Messrs. S H. SCHEUBLE & Co. to the great London Exhibition of 1851, and for which they obtained a well-merited prize.

In the meantime, my pamphlet met with a reception which surpassed my most sanguine expectations, and as it soon became scarce, on account of the very limited number of copies printed at the time, I was urged by different parties, to prepare and issue a second impression.

Thus emboldened by repeated applications, I yield with pleasure to the call, the more so, as I have since been enabled to correct, improve, and make numerous additions.

Having been left entirely to my own resources, I greatly regret the total want of co-operation on the part of the country practitioners, who have daily and ample opportunities of making themselves acquainted with the various domestic remedies commonly used.

The contents, therefore, of the present publication can be considered only as preliminary, or as mere contributions to a more complete Cape Pharmacopœia. There can, indeed, be no doubt amongst reasonable men that, judging from the vast extent of the South African Territory, and from the richness of its almost inexhaustible Flora, many highly useful officinal drugs will still be discovered. However, the greater part of our information on this point, we owe, not so much to scientific research, as to the experience of the colonial farmer, residing in the more remote parts of the interior, to occasional travellers, or to the wandering native.

{11}------------------------------------------------

In reviewing the first edition, I have found it advisable to deviate to some extent from the original plan, by inserting in the list several plants, which, though not strictly indigenous, have yet become fully naturalized, and are much used in the Colony.

There are, on the other hand, Cape plants of unquestionable worth, which I have not enumerated, because they are not actually employed by the inhabitants. The different kinds of *Sebæa* (Gentianæ), for instance, possess a pleasant, bitter taste; they could replace the *Summitates Centaurei minoris* of the Pharmacopæias, and even serve as a good substitute for Gentian. The large tuberous roots of many of our beautiful and common *Orchidæ*, such as *Satyrrium* erectum, cucullatum, candidum, carneum, *Disa* barbata, lacera, etc., contain a great quantity of a sweet mucilaginous, nutritious juice, and might easily be transformed into *Salep*. The dried and powdered leaves of our wild *Olive* trees (*Olea verrucosa* and *laurifolia*) have the reputation of a styptic, when applied to fresh bleeding wounds, and the herb of *Chironia baccifera* to be of good service in syphilis. A decoction of the gamboge-yellow, crusty epidermis of the bark of *Elæodendron croceum* (Saffron-wood), is said by some to counteract the deadly effects of the bites from venomous snakes, when taken internally, and the bark of *Protea grandiflora*, to act as an astringent in diarrhœa and other complaints.

For the purpose of rendering this publication accessible to persons more familiar with the sexual than the natural system, I have added the *Linnean* classes and orders to which the plants belong, as well as a glossary of technical terms, which, in works on Natural History, are indispensable.

## AN ENUMERATION OF SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL PLANTS.

### KNOWLTONIA. SALISB.

(*Ranunculaceæ.*)

### XIII.—6. POLYANDRIA POLYGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

1. *Knowltonia vesicatoria.* Sims. Herbaceous. *Leaves* triternate, leathery, smooth; segments oval or subcordate, sawed; lateral ones obliquely truncate at base. *Flowers* umbellate; *umbel* nearly unbranched, few-flowered; *flowers* yellowish; *petals* linear.

Every part of this acrid plant is used as an Epispastic. The bruised herb, when applied to a painful part, raises a blister. It is therefore recommended in rheumatism, ischias, lumbago, and similar affections caused by sudden atmospheric changes. The root, when cut in slices, is a good substitute for Emplastrum Janini. The plant is found in almost every part of the Colony, and from its effects is well known by the name of *Brandblåræn*.

### RANUNCULUS. LIN.

(*Ranunculaceæ.*)

### XIII.—6. POLYANDRIA POLYGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

2. *Ranunculus pubescens.* Thbg. Root fibrous. *Stem* herbaceous, erect, downy; all the *leaves* hairy; the radical ones petiolate, ternate, their leaflets incisodentate. *Leaves* of the *stem* either trifid or subpinnatifid, toothed; the uppermost sessile. *Flowers* stalked, single, terminal, yellow. *Calyx* reflexed; *carpels* smooth, slightly mucronate, tuberculated.

This herb grows in ditches and marshes, etc., and is peculiar to the Cape and Uitenhage districts. The expressed juice, when fresh, is recommended in carcinomatous ulcers, and therefore has received the Dutch name of *Kankerblåren*.

{13}------------------------------------------------

### CISSAMPELOS. LIN.

*(Menispermaceæ.)*

XXII.—10. DIOECIA MONADELPHIA. LIN. SYST.

3. *Cissampelos capensis*. Lin. Stem shrubby, twining. Leaves ovate, petiolate, blunt, entire, glabrous; leaf-stalks, short, downy. Flower bunches branchy, hardly longer than the leaf-stalks. Flowers dioecious, axillary, minute, whitish, tomentose.

This shrub is found in almost every mountainous part of the Colony. The roots are used as an emetic and purgative by the Boers, and go by the name of *Davidjes*. Its foliage is poisonous to cattle.

### POLYGALA. TOURN.

*(Polygaleæ.)*

XVII.—5. DIADELPHIA OCTO-DECANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

4. *Polygala Serpentaria*. Eckl. and Z. Root thick, woody. Stem almost herbaceous, branchy, procumbent. Leaves alternate, obovate, smooth, entire, glaucous beneath, mucronate. Flowers on short pedicels, axillary, suberistate.

A shrub found in Kaffraria. Though small, yet the root is comparatively thick and long, and is considered by the natives as a sure antidote against the bites of venomous snakes, whence its colonial name of *Kaffer Slangenwortel*. It belongs to the same section of the genus as the *Polygala Senega*, and may probably possess similar properties.

### MUNDTIA. KUNTH.

*(Polygaleæ.)*

XVII.—5. DIADELPHIA OCTANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

5. *Mundtia spinosa*. D. C. Shrubby, erect, smooth, divaricating. Branches spiny at their apices. Leaves on short stalks, oblong, glabrous, veiny, blunt, mucronate. Flowers crested, sessile, axillary. Fruit a red, juicy berry.

A decoction of the tops of the branches of this shrub, which is very common in the Downs, is used in atrophy, phthisis, &c., apparently with some effect, while the fruit, which is somewhat astringent in taste, is eaten by children and Hottentots, who call them *Skildpatbesjes*.

{14}------------------------------------------------

### MALVA. LIN.

(Malvaceæ.)

### XVI.—9. MONADELPHIA POLYANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

6. *Malva rotundifolia*. Lin. Stem prostrate; leaves stalked, cordate, nearly obicular, serrato-crenate, five-lobed, smooth. Flowers small, axillary. Fruit-stalks downy, bent downwards.

The whole of this plant is mucilaginous and emollient. Although a native of Europe, it has now become perfectly naturalized, and grows everywhere near towns and villages. The colonists know it by the name of *Keesjes-blåren* (mallow leaves), and frequently use its leaves in the forms of decoction, fomentation, or poultice in sore throat, ophthalmia, or for the purpose of maturing abscesses.

### PAPPEA. ECK. AND ZEYH.

(Sapindaceæ.)

### XXII.—7. DIOECIA OCTO-DECANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

7. *Pappea capensis*. E. and Z. A small tree. Leaves alternate, ovate, oblong, unequal at base, glabrous, blunt, coriaceous, veiny, slightly rolled back at the margin. Flowers small, racemose, with separate sexes by abortion. Fruit tricapsular, drupaceous, fleshy, globose, downy.

This tree is pretty common in Kaffirland, and in the districts of Uitenhage and Albany, where its fruit is known as *wilde pruimen* or *t'Kaamsbesjes* (wild plums). It has some resemblance to the plum, is savoury, and furnishes a vinous beverage and excellent vinegar. Its kernel contains an oil, which, though edible, is somewhat purgative, and is recommended as an external remedy in *tinca capitis*, *alopecia*, or similar diseases, and may serve as a substitute for Macassar oil.

### DODONÆA. LIN.

(Sapindaceæ.)

### XXII.—8. DIOECIA OCTANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

8. *Dodonæa Thunbergiana*. E. and Z. Stem shrubby, with angular branches. Leaves at the top of the twigs, sessile, alternate, narrow, lanceolate, attenuate at both ends, acute, entire, smooth. Flowers

{15}------------------------------------------------

terminal, erect, stalked, small, greenish. *Fruit* a winged three-celled capsule.

A small tree or shrub, common about Piquetberg, Worcester and Clanwilliam, where it is called *Zand Olyf*. A decoction of the root is used as a slight purgative in fevers.

### MONSONIA. LIN. FIL.

(*Geraniaceæ.*)

### XVI.—7. MONADELPHIA DECANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

9. *Monsonia ovata* Cav. *Root* annual, spindle-shaped. *Stem* herbaceous, simple, erect, shaggy. *Leaves* stalked, alternate, oblongo-ovate, subcordate at base, veiny, crenate, wavy, pubescent, *Stipules* and *bractlets* awl-shaped, rigid. *Peduncles* one-flowered, bracteate in the middle, villose. *Flowers* white, with purplish veins.

The *Keita* of the Hottentots. The root and herb of this plant are very astringent, and used with great success in dysentery. It grows abundantly in the district of Uitenhage.

### PELARGONIUM. L'HER.

(*Geraniaceæ.*)

### XVI.—4. MONADELPHIA HEPTANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

10. *Pelargonium (Polyactium) triste*. Ait. *Root* tuberous. *Leaves* alternate, tripinnatifid, hispid; their *segments* bipinnatifid, and their *pinnules* wedge-shaped, incised. *Umbel* many-flowered. *Flowers* scented, yellow, with a dark purple spot at base.

The scarlet-coloured root of this *Pelargonium* is somewhat astringent. If dried and pulverised, it is useful in diarrhœa and certain forms of dysentery, where purgatives have been previously given. It has also been recommended as a vermifuge, and is commonly found on the sides of Table Mountain.

11. *Pelargonium (Jenkinsonia) antidysentericum*. E. and Z. *Stem* tuberous, fleshy. *Branches* lateral, erect, furrowed, angular. *Leaves* smooth, alternate, stalked, subcordate, lobed. *Lobes* incised. *Petioles* curved, longer than the leaves. *Stipules* prickly. *Flowers*

{16}------------------------------------------------

purplish, and the nectariferous tube twice as long as the calyx.

This plant, which is indigenous in Namaqualand, has tuberous roots, which often attain the size of a man's head, and are called *t'Namie* by the aborigines, who boil them with milk, and make use of them in dysentery.

12. *Pelargonium* (*Peristera*) *anceps*. *Ait.* Herbaceous, smooth. *Stems* decumbent, three-sided, two-edged. *Leaves* petiolate, roundish, cordate, lobed, toothed. *Stipules* oblong, two-parted. *Peduncles* axillary, elongated, umbellate. *Umbels* many-flowered. *Flowers* subcapitate, small, crimson.

This species, which grows plentifully along the water-courses in the Cape and Swellendam districts, is a great favourite with the Malays, who call it *roode Rabassam*, and pretend that a decoction of the herb cures suppression of the catamenia, and promotes parturition and *abortion*.

13. *Pelargonium cucullatum*. *Ait.* *Stem* shrubby, the whole plant viscid, hairy. *Leaves* alternate, kidney-shaped, hooded, waved, dentato-crenate. *Petioles* patent, channelled, longer than the leaves. *Flowers* terminal, umbellate, purple. *Umbels* many-flowered.

This fine species, which is very common along the side of Table Mountain, has been recommended in the form of decoction, or as an enema, in colic, nephritis, and suppression of urine, and is also an excellent emollient. It appears, that formerly this herb has been exported to Holland, under the name of *Herba Altheæ*. *Cf. N. L. Burmanni Specimen Botanicum de Geraniis*. Lugd. Bat. 1759, 4to pag. 35.

14. *Pelargonium*. (*Dibrachya*.) *scutatum* *Sweet*. *Stem* shrub-like. *Branches* angular, somewhat downy. *Leaves* fleshy, five-lobed, nearly peltate, glandularly notched. *Umbels* 7-8 flowered. *Petals* patent.

The *Kafir-sorrel* (Kaffir zuring.) of the colonists. The *sap* of its leaves is astringent and antiseptic, and of good service in aphthæ, sore-throat, etc. The juice of its petals produces a blue colour of the tint of indigo, and may, according to *Burchell*, be advantageously used for painting. Very common in many parts of the Eastern districts.

{17}------------------------------------------------

### OXALIS. LIN.

(Oxalideæ.)

### X.—5. DECANDRIA PENTAGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

15. *Oxalis cernua*. Lin. Root bulbous. Leaves radical, stalked, ternate. Leaflets obcordate, two-lobed, often blotched, smooth. Scape erect, umbelliferous. Flowers peduncled, the open ones erect, the closed ones drooping.

A weed, common throughout a great portion of the colony, where it is known as the *wild sorrel* (wilde zuring). On account of their acidity, the leaves, mixed with other vegetables, are used for culinary purposes. They contain, indeed, a good deal of *oxalic acid*, and Thunberg relates that, at his time, this salt in its crystallized form was easily obtained from the juice of this plant. The *bulbs*, moreover, eaten raw, are said to be a good vermifuge.

### MELIANTHUS. LIN.

(Zygophylleæ.)

### XIV.—2. DIDYNAMIA ANGIOSPERMIA. LIN. SYST.

16. *Melianthus major*. Lin. Shrubby. Leaves alternate, smooth, unequally pinnate, glaucous beneath. Leaflets sharply-toothed. Stipules large, solitary, foliaceous, adnate with the leaf-stalk. Flowers racemose, reddish brown. Peduncles twisted, downy.

Every part of this plant has a nauseous smell, whence it has received the Dutch name of *Truytje roer my niet* (Gertrude, don't touch me). A decoction of the leaves is an excellent external remedy in *tinea capitis*, *crusta serpiginosa*,\* *necrosis*, and foul ulcers. It is also useful as a gargle and lotion in sore throat and in diseases of the gums, and the bruised leaves, applied to ulcers, pro-

---

\* A shoemaker, about 25 years of age, had laboured for some time under a most obstinate attack of *crusta serpiginosa*. All the usual remedies having failed, his medical attendant at last advised him to try a decoction of this plant, to be applied in a tepid state. With this treatment, and occasional aperients and spare diet, he was perfectly cured within a month.

{18}------------------------------------------------

mote granulation.\* It is common in the Cape Flats, and other parts of the colony, and deserves a trial in cases of plica polonica.

### DIOSMA. LIN.

(*Diosmææ.*)

### V.—1. PENTANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

17. *Diosma* (*Barosma*) *crenata*. *D. C.* A glabrous branchy shrub. *Branches* round, purplish, the upper and smaller ones angular. *Leaves* stalked, smooth, oblongo-ovate, blunt, dotted beneath, and notched with transparent, resinous glands on their margin. *Flowers* peduncled, solitary, axillary; *petals* white, oblong, subsessile.

The *Bucchu* leaves have, as is well known, become an article of export lately. Their principal medical effects are owing to their possessing a considerable quantity of an aromatic volatile oil, and to a particular very tenacious principle, called *Diosmin*, as also to a semi-resinous substance. They have a peculiar smell, and a slightly astringent, bitter, taste. When used in the form of infusion, they promote perspiration. Hence their utility in chronic rheumatism, gout, and other diseases, caused by the sudden suppression of cutaneous action. They have been prescribed also in cholera morbus, and are very beneficial in diseases of the bladder, especially in chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of that organ (catarrh of the

\* I am indebted to my friend, Dr. A. BROWN, for the following practical remarks on the medical properties of this plant:—"For many years past, I have found the *Melianthus major* very serviceable in necrosis and foul ulcers, and its effect in promoting granulation is very remarkable. After cleaning the sores with the decoction, some of the boiled leaves are applied to the parts, and found to answer well. I have not only used it with decided benefit, but in many cases where the *materia medica* has failed me, or the degree of healing was not satisfactory, it has almost invariably succeeded. In carcinoma I have seen it applied with effect in cleaning the ulcers, and rendering their otherwise highly disagreeable odour less offensive. In indolent leprous sores it can also vie with the other applications that we use in that intractable disease. I have tried it in tinea capitis with great effect, but in other affections of the skin it has as yet failed to satisfy me decidedly whether it did good or not. In cases where tinctura myrrhæ is recommended, I have found it a better remedy. In fact, I may say that in my practice it is almost daily used."

{19}------------------------------------------------

bladder); also in hæmaturia, calculus, and in suppuration of the vesica, urethra, and prostrate gland. By increasing the secretion of urine, they impart to it their peculiar smell. They have also been given in dropsy;—in fine, in all those cachectic and hydropical complaints, arising from suppression of the perspiration or urine. As a stimulant to the stomach, some practitioners have used the bucchu leaves in indigestion; a sensation of warmth has accordingly been produced in that organ, and the appetite increased.

A bath of the bucchu leaves is of service in rheumatism, and the *Bucchu vinegar*, as also the *Bucchu brandy*, are excellent embrocations in rheumatic pains, luxations, sugilations, sprains, and contusions.

In trade, this valuable drug is often adulterated by the substitution of less powerful sorts of the same family of plants, which, although of a similar smell, are by no means equal to it in their therapeutic effects. One of these plants is the *Diosma* (*Barosma*) *serratifolia*. *Lodd.*, a species common in the district of Swellendam, and another, the *Empleurum serrulatum*. *Sol.*, easily distinguished by its linear-lanceolate, serrated leaves.

The true *Diosma crenata* is a native of the mountains of Hottentot's Holland, Stellenbosch, Drakenstein, Tulbagh, and Worcester.

### FAGARASTRUM. DON.

(*Xanthoxyleæ.*)

### VIII.—1. OCTANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

18. *Fagarastrum capense*. *Don.* A shrub, about 6 feet high. *Branches* compressed, flexuous, wrinkled, prickly. *Prickles* flat, sharp-pointed. *Leaves* alternate, impari-pinnate; *pinnæ* ovate, blunt, erect, sessile, smooth, slightly crenate. *Flowers* small, paniculate. *Capsule* dotted; *seeds* black, shining.

Found in the bush near Mossel Bay, and in the forests of the district of George, as also in those of Uitenhage and Albany. The fruit is known to the colonists as the *wild Cardamom*, and, on account of its aromatic qualities, prescribed for flatulency and paralysis.

{20}------------------------------------------------

### METHYSCOPHYLLUM. ECKL. AND ZEYH.

(Amyridaceæ.)

### V.—1. PENTANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

19. *Methyscophyllum glaucum*. *E. and Z.* A resinous shrub. *Branches* erect, alternate. *Leaves* opposite, lanceolate, pointed at both ends, veiny, glabrous, glaucous, repando-dentate, bent back at the margin. *Flowers* paniculated. *Panicles* axillary, opposite, forked, few-flowered.

An infusion of the leaves of this shrub is pleasant to the taste, and used in cough, asthma, and other diseases of the chest. It grows about the Zwarté Kei River, where it is a favourite beverage with the Bushmen and others, who also chew it, and call it *Boschjesmansthee*.

### CYCLOPIA. VENT.

(Leguminosæ.)

### X.—1. DECANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

20. *Cyclopia genistoides*. *Vent.* A glabrous shrub. *Stem* and *branches* erect, twiggy. *Leaves* alternate, sessile, trifoliolate; *leaflets* linear, bluntly mucronate, revolute at the margin. *Flowers* axillary, bracteate, stalked, yellow. *Peduncles* one-flowered *Bracts* two, oblongo-ovate, pointed.

This plant is common in moist places on the Cape Flats, near Wynberg, Houtbay, and elsewhere. In the form of decoction or infusion, it is often made use of for the purpose of promoting expectoration in chronic catarrh, and even in consumption. It has a sweet, astringent taste, and is generally considered as a restorative. Its vernacular name is *Honigthee*.

### BORBONIA. LIN.

(Leguminosæ.)

### XVII.—6. DIADELPHIA DECANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

21. *Borbonia parviflora*. *Lamk.* A small, glabrous shrub. *Branches* compressed, angular, winged. *Leaves* alternate, amplexicaul, cordate, many-nerved, mucronate, ciliato-dentate. *Calyx* and *corolla* nearly smooth. *Flowers* yellow.

Common on the Lion's Head and on Table Mountain,

{21}------------------------------------------------

and used, under the significant name of *Stekelthee*, apparently with good effect in asthma and hydrothorax. It is commonly given as a diuretic, in the form of decoction.

### VASCOA. D. C. (*Leguminosæ.*)

### XVII.—6. DIADELPHIA DECANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

22. *Vascoa amplexicaulis*. D. C. A glabrous undershrub. *Stem* erect, branchy. *Leaves* simple, amplexicaul, suborbicular, cordate at base, reticulated, quite entire, blunt; those of the stem alternate; the floral ones opposite, coloured. *Flowers* in the upper axils, glabrous, solitary, without bracts, shortly pedicellate, yellow.

The roots of this pretty bush taste like liquorice, whence its name of *Zoethout-boschje*. They are used in the form of decoction, as a demulcent in catarrh and phthisis, and are a good substitute for the liquorice itself. This useful plant inhabits the mountains of Worcester and Tulbagh.

23. *Vascoa perfoliata*. D. C. A small shrub. *Stem* glabrous, erect. *Leaves* amplexicaul, cordate, suborbicular, entire, bluntly mucronate, rigid, netted. *Flowers* yellow.

A strong decoction of the leaves of this species acts as a powerful diuretic, and is of great service in the various forms of dropsy. It grows on the mountains of Hottentot's Holland.

### MELILOTUS. TOURN. (*Leguminosæ.*)

### XVII.—6. DIADELPHIA DECANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

24. *Melilotus parviflorus*. Desf. *Stem* erect, branchy. *Leaves* trifoliolate, upper ones oblong, toothed; lower ones obovate, entire. *Flowers* laxely racemose, small, yellow; *stipules* linear; *legumes* ovate, wrinkled, one-seeded.

This herb (*Melilot*, *Steenklaver*), a native also of the north of Africa, diffuses the same sweet, fragrant scent which we observe in the *Melilotus officinalis* of Europe. In its medical effects it is discutient and emollient, and used externally in the form of fomentation, poultice, and plaster, in indurations, glandular tumours, etc. Its powder is one

{22}------------------------------------------------

of the ingredients in the manufacture of snuff. Abundant in sandy soil in many parts of the colony, where it flowers from September to November.

### SUTHERLANDIA. R. BR.

(*Leguminosæ.*)

### XVII.—6. DIADELPHIA DECANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

25. *Sutherlandia frutescens*. R. Br. Shrubby. *Stem* erect, twiggy. *Leaves* stalked, alternate, impari-pinnate, many-yoked; *pinnules* on short petioles, oblong, obtuse, emarginate, silky. *Flowers* racemose, peduncled, axillary, scarlet. *Legume* ovate, scariosus, inflated.

A fine showy shrub, which, on account of its beautiful scarlet flowers, is a horticultural ornament, and cultivated as such in our gardens. It grows wild in hilly parts all over the colony. According to *Thunberg* (Travels, vol. I., pag. 160), the roots and leaves of this plant, when dried and pulverised, are of use in diseases of the eye.

### ACACIA. NECK.

(*Leguminosæ.*)

### XVI.—9. MONADELPHIA POLYANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

26. *Acacia horrida*. Willd. A large tree. *Stem* and *branches* glabrous, but armed with large white spinous stipules. *Leaves* bipinnate; *pinnæ* 2-3 yoked; *pinnules* many-yoked, oblong, blunt. *Leafstalks* glandulous at base and on the apex. *Flowers* stalked, axillary, globose, polygamous, yellow, scented.

The demulcent derived from the *Doornboom* is well known as an article of commerce. It exudes spontaneously from the bark of the trunk and branches, and hardens in the sun, without losing its transparency. Although the *Cape gum* is inferior in appearance, and in intrinsic value, to that of Northern Africa, it may yet be improved by care and attention. The bark of this useful tree is highly astringent, hence its effect, in the form of decoction, in inveterate *fluor albus*, in diarrhoea, dysentery, and as a substitute for the Peruvian bark in fevers. The *Acacia giraffæ*. Willd. (*Kameeldoorn*), growing beyond the limits of the Cape Colony, is said to yield a superior gum, and is eaten by the natives.

{23}------------------------------------------------

### RUBUS. LIN.

(Rosaceæ.)

### XII.—3. ICOSANDRIA POLYGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

27. *Rubus pinnatus*. Willd. Shrubby. *Branches, stalks, and nerves* of the leaves clothed with short down, and armed with hooked prickles. *Leaves* alternate, petioled, ovate, acuminate, double-sawed, veiny, smooth. *Stipules* narrow, taper-pointed. *Calyx* tomentose, its segments longer than the petals. *Flowers* racemose. *Fruit* black.

The roots are astringent, and used as decoction for chronic diarrhœa, etc. The fruit of this species of *Bramble* or *Blackberry-bush* (Braambosch) is equal in flavour and taste to that of Europe. Abundant in mountain ravines in the Cape and Stellenbosch districts. *Flowers*, October, November. *Fruit*, January.

### CLIFFORTIA. LIN.

(Sanguisorbeæ.)

### XIII.—2. POLYANDRIA DIGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

28. *Cliffortia ilicifolia*. Lin. Shrubby. *Stem* brown, scaly, branched. *Leaves* cordato-ovate, elliptical, 3–5 toothed, spiny, many-nerved, amplexicaul, rigid, imbricated, smooth. *Flowers* dioecious, small, axillary, subsessile.

A plant pretty common in the district of Uitenhage, where the Boers recommend it as an emollient and expectorant in coughs. This species, whose leaves are sharp-pointed and spiny, is called *Doornthee*.

### PUNICA. TOURN.

(Granateæ.)

### XII.—1. ICOSANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

29. *Punica granatum*. Lin. A shrubby tree. *Branches* often thorny. *Leaves* opposite, entire, lance-shaped, pointed at each end, smooth. *Flowers* at the top of the branches; *petals* scarlet, wrinkled. *Fruit* round, with a coriaceous rind; *pulp* acidulous; *seeds* oblong, angular.

The rind of the *Pomegranate* (Granaat-appel) and its roots are astringent, and contain tannin and gallie-acid. They are used in diarrhœa, accompanying general debility,

{24}------------------------------------------------

in the form of decoction, while infusions are known to be of service as injections in obstinate leucorrhœa. From the pulp surrounding the seeds, a refrigerating syrup is prepared. The efficacy of the fresh bark of the root was known to the Ancients, who praised it as a sure remedy for the expulsion of the tape-worm. This effect has been tested in our days with decided success. The best way of using the remedy is in the form of a decoction of two ounces of the bark in two pints of water, boiled down to one pint. A wine-glassful taken every hour early in the morning is the dose generally administered.

Though a native of the north of Africa, the Pomegranate tree is extensively cultivated within the colony, especially for the purpose of forming hedges.

### EPILOBIUM. LIN.

(*Onagrarie.*)

### VIII.—1. OCTANDRIA MONOGYNYA. LIN. SYST.

30. *Epilobium villosum.* Thbg. Stem herbaceous, erect, round, branched, shaggy. Leaves sessile, alternate, lanceolate, sawed, acute, hairy. Flowers terminal, axillary, purple.

As a house-medicine, this herb, inhabiting the mountains of several districts, is renowned for its usefulness in cleansing foul ulcers.

### PILOGYNE. SCHRAD.

(*Cucurbitaceæ.*)

### XXII.—3. DIOECIA TRIANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

31. *Pilogyne Ecklonii.* Schrad. Dioecious. Root tuberous; stem climbing. Branches striped, nearly quadrangular. Leaves stalked, triangular, cordate, 3-lobed, sharp-pointed, toothed, green and rough above; white, downy beneath. Flowers stalked, axillary; male ones small, white, racemose; female ones solitary.

The porous resinous root of this old Hottentot remedy is nauseous in taste. In the form of decoction, it acts simultaneously as an emetic, cathartic, and diuretic. The natives call it *Davidjes-wortel*, and use it in cutaneous affections, dropsy, and syphilis. The tincture, or infusion of the root in wine or brandy, is, according to *Thunberg*

{25}------------------------------------------------

(Travels, I., pag. 128), a powerful emetic and purgative. This plant, the *Bryonia Africana* of former botanists, grows upon the slopes of Table Mountain, amongst bushes; also in the Eastern districts, near Port Elizabeth, etc., and flowers in the month of October.

### CITRULLUS. SCHR.

(*Cucurbitacæ.*)

### XVI.—10. MONOECIA MONADELPHIA. LIN. SYST.

32. *Citrullus amarus*. Schrad. *Stem* angular, furrowed, hispid, decumbent. *Leaves* alternate, stalked; the upper ones 3-parted; middle segment sinuated, pinnatifid; lateral ones 2 fid; lobes blunt, scabrid, pimpled; radical leaves 5-parted. *Tendrils* axillary. *Flowers* dioecious. *Fruit* glabrous, elliptico-globose.

This annual plant resembles a water-melon in foliage. Its fruit, a round pepo of the size of a child's head, is filled with a spongy pulp. By the farmer, this fruit, which is bitter and loathsome, is called *Bitter-appel* or *Wild Water-melon*,\* and is common in the sands of the Cape Downs, near Tygerberg and Rietvalley, and in similar localities. The pulp of the pepo, like that of *Colocynth*, is a very strong, drastic purgative, and serves the same purpose, and is used as a cathartic in dropsy and other complaints. An extract can easily be prepared from it, equal in its effects to the extract of *Colocynth*.

### PHARNACEUM. LIN.

(*Paronychiacæ.*)

### V.—3. PENTANDRIA TRIGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

33. *Pharnaceum lineare*. Thbg. Suffruticose. *Root* fibrous, stemless. *Branches* radical, diffused, smooth, repeatedly forked. *Leaves* sessile, whorled, linear, unequal, entire, patent, blunt. *Stipules* scarious, torn.

---

\* Thunberg (Trav. II., p. 171) relates, that at the Cape the *Colocynth*-fruit is eaten, when pickled, both by the natives and colonists, although it is very bitter.—This is a mistake: the fruit alluded to by that author, is that of *Citrullus caffer*. Schrad., called by the colonists, *Kaffir-watermeloen*.

{26}------------------------------------------------

*Peduncles* axillary, elongated, terminal. *Flowers* paniculate or umbellate, white and purplish.

This little plant, which thrives best in a sandy soil, and abounds in the Cape Flats and Downs, is employed in pulmonary affections. It is generally used in the form of infusion, which is of a rather pleasant, aromatic, bitter taste, and is also somewhat mucilaginous and slightly diuretic. By the name of *Droedas kruiden*, it is known to many colonists, who make use of it in coughs, and especially in those that threaten consumption.

### CRASSULA. LIN.

(*Crassulaceæ.*)

### V.—5. PENTANDRIA PENTAGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

34. *Crassula tetragona*. *Lin.* *Stem* suffruticose, succulent, round, branchy, procumbent, smooth. *Branches* alternate, erect. *Leaves* connate, decussate, three-sided, incurved, acute, entire. *Flowers* terminal, corymbose, small, white.

A succulent plant, rather astringent, and a native of the district of Uitenhage. If boiled in milk, the leaves of this species are used as a tonic in diarrhœa. The *Crassula portulacacea* *Lam.*, which is called *t'Karkey* by the Hottentots, is said to be used in similar cases.

### TETRAPHYLE. ECK. AND ZEYH.

(*Crassulaceæ.*)

### V.—5. PENTANDRIA PENTAGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

35. *Tetraphyle furcata*. *E. and Z.* *Root* fleshy, scaly, spreading. *Stem* erect. *Branches* quadrangular, fastigiæte. *Leaves* standing in fours, small, ovato-lanceolate, imbricated, smooth. *Flowers* 5-10, terminal.

This plant becomes very brittle when dried. It is bitter and astringent, and used in the form of decoction for diarrhœa and dysentery. During one of the late Kafir wars, when the latter disease prevailed amongst the troops, this remedy appears to have been tried with marked success.

### COTYLEDON. LIN.

(*Crassulaceæ.*)

### X.—5. DECANDRIA PENTAGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

36. *Cotyledon orbiculata*. *Lin.* *Stem* fleshy, leafless, elongated, branchy. *Leaves* opposite, flat, obovate,

{27}------------------------------------------------

spatulate, blunt, acuminate, (often) farinaceously glaucous, with a red border. *Flowers* paniculate, nodding.

This succulent shrub is common in mountainous parts. The leaves are thick, and from their shape called *Varkensooren* (pig's ears). The fresh juice is of service in epilepsy, and has been prescribed by me in the case of a young man, subject to this frightful disease. Not only were the symptoms evidently diminished, but subsequent attacks were less violent. The leaves form an excellent application to hard corns. On removal of the epidermis of the upper side of the leaf, it is left on the part for 8 or 10 hours, when it will be found that the juicy portion of the leaf is gone, and the corn feels soft, and may be removed with ease. It should be remarked here, that *Crassula arborescens*. *Willd.*, has the same properties.

### MESEMBRYANTHEMUM. LIN.

(*Ficoideæ.*)

### XII.—2. ICOSANDRIA PENTAGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

37. *Mesembryanthemum edule*. *Lin.* Suffruticose; succulent. *Stem* erect. *Branches* two-edged, prostrate, spreading. *Leaves* opposite, connate, scimitar-shaped, three-edged, fleshy, serrulate at their edge, perfectly smooth. *Flowers* solitary, terminal, large, yellow or purple. *Fruit* eatable.

Few South-African plants are so much in domestic use than this species and *Mesembryanthemum acinaciforme*. *Lin.*, both of which are common in the sandy tracts of the colony. They are astringent and sourish in taste, on account of the acidulated alkaline salt with which they seem to be impregnated. The expressed juice of the succulent leaves, taken internally, checks dysentery, and acts as a mild diuretic; while it is also for its antiseptic property, used as an excellent gargle in malignant sore throat, violent salivation and aphthæ, or in the form of a lotion in burns and scalds. At the Cape these plants are called *Hottentots vygen* (Hottentot-figs).

38. *Mesembryanthemum crystallinum*. *Lin.* Root annual. *Stem* herbaceous, angular, procumbent, fleshy, covered all over with large pustules. *Leaves* broad, amplexicaul, waved at the margin, ovate, entire. *Flowers* axillary, nearly sessile, small white.

The *Iceplant* contains a good deal of malic acid and lime. The expressed juice of the herb, when fresh and

{28}------------------------------------------------

rendered limpid, has been recommended as a specific in incontinence of urine, proceeding from spasm (*Enuresis spastica*), and is given in doses of a tablespoonful at intervals. The Iceplant is common in the neighbourhood of Cape Town, especially in the sandy flat near Riet-valley, where it flowers in the midst of summer.

39. *Mesembryanthemum tortuosum*. *Lin.* Stem short. Branches procumbent, elongated, divaricating, twisted. Leaves connate, pointed, entire, oblongo-ovate, concave, somewhat pustular, keeled, crowded. Lobes of the calyx unequal.

This species, a native of the Karroo, appears to possess narcotic properties. The Hottentots, who know it by the name of *Kaun-goed*, are in the habit of chewing it, and become intoxicated, while the farmers use it in the form of decoction or tincture, as a good sedative.

### HYDROCOTYLE. LIN. (*Umbelliferae*.)

### V.—2. PENTANDRIA DIGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

40. *Hydrocotyle Centella*. *Cham.* Suffruticose. Stems filiform, decumbent, geniculate, flexuose. Leaves stalked, oblongo-lanceolate, 3-nerved, subfalcate, pubescent, acuminate, entire. Flowers 3-5 polygamous, umbellate, whorled, axillary. Involucral bracts 4-5, ovato-lanceolate, acute. Petals glabrous.

The roots and stalks of this plant are astringent, and a decoction of them is used with effect by many colonists in violent diarrhœa. They are also said to be of great service in cases of dysentery, after the necessary evacuations have been previously procured, and where the disease has assumed a chronic form. Among the farmers, the plant is known under the name of *Persgras*; it inhabits the Cape and Stellenbosch districts, and grows abundantly about Vlaggeberg.

41. *Hydrocotyle asiatica*. *Lin.* Stems slender, prostrate, creeping. Leaves stalked, reniform, crenato-dentate, ribbed, smooth. Flowers small, axillary. Umbels simple, few-flowered. Leaf and flower-stalks slightly tomentose.

Found in moist, shady localities, at watercourses, and in the beds of empty rivers, throughout a great portion of

{29}------------------------------------------------

the colony. This small plant has of late been recommended in India as a remedy for leprosy, and the Madras *United Service Gazette* states, that the local Government had authorised its use at the Leper Hospital. The use of this plant was discovered by Mr. Jules Lepine, of Pondicherry, and instantly communicated to the Madras authorities and the public. He was guided to his discovery by Dr. Boileau of the Mauritius, who himself suffering from this fearful disease, had devoted himself to experiments with it. Of 40 adult patients, to whom it had been administered, all were in a fair way for recovery in 1853. How far the real efficacy of this new remedy can be proved by experience, remains to be seen.

### SIUM. LIN.

(*Umbelliferae.*)

### V.—2. PENTANDRIA DYGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

42. *Sium Thunbergii*. D. C. Herbaceous. Root fibrous, stoloniferous. Stem erect. Branches angular. Leaves pinnate; leaflets ovate, pointed, regularly sawed. Umbels stalked, lateral or terminal; segments of the involucre (3-5) linear, entire. Flowers white.

In marshy spots near Zeekoe-valley, in the bed of the Zwartkops-river, and in similar localities. Flowers February and March.

The root of this umbelliferous plant, called *Tandpynwortel* (Toothache-root) by the colonists, is renowned for its allaying toothache when held in the mouth or chewed.

### BUBON. LIN.

(*Umbelliferae.*)

### V.—2. PENTANDRIA DIGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

43. *Bubon Galbanum*. Lin. A smooth, resinous shrub: Stem erect, round, geniculated, branchy. Leaves alternate, pinnate, trinervate, rigid, glaucous; segments rhomboidal, toothed, or pinnatifid; terminal ones 3-lobed. Petioles sheathing. Umbels compound, many-rayed. Involucres many-leaved. Leaflets linear. Flowers yellowish-green.

This umbelliferous plant, which attains a height of from six to eight feet, and is found all over the colony in moist places, or in the ravines of mountains, is reputed amongst the inhabitants as an excellent diuretic, under the name

{30}------------------------------------------------

of *Wild Celery*. A decoction of its leaves proves salutary in cases of dropsy, and has been even administered successfully in gravel. At times some resinous matter exudes from the stem, which however, in its appearance, smell, and in every respect, greatly differs from the *Gummi galbanum*, the well-known drug of our dispensaries. Linnæus, in giving the name to this species, seems to have been led astray by mistake, the real drug being derived from a different plant, a native of the north of Africa, and probably from a kind of *Ferula*.

### ARCTOPUS. LIN.

(*Umbelliferae.*)

### V.—2. PENTANDRIA DIGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

44. *Arctopus echinatus*. Lin. Root spindle-shaped, resinous, stemless. Radical leaves, pressed to the ground, stellate, hispid; their expanded lobes nearly round, incisid, 3 fid; single lobes dentate, ciliated, spiny. Flowers dioecious, umbellate; male umbel stalked, female sessile. Petals white.

This plant, the *Platdoorn* or *Ziekte-troost* of the Boers, is one of those few indigenous remedies, which, from the very establishment of the colony, have been constantly used by its inhabitants. At that early period, the European settlers, being often without their necessary stock of medicines, had to learn from their Hottentot neighbours, who held this plant in great esteem. It is demulcent and diuretic, and somewhat approaches the *Sarsaparilla*. The decoction of the root is the general form under which it is prescribed in lues, lepra, or cutaneous chronic eruptions of all kinds. It also furnishes a sort of resin, which is easily procurable by making incisions into the root while it is fresh. It has been shown from chemical experiments, that the root of this plant contains an alkaloid, which, combined with acids, assumes the form of neutral salts. Thus the *Arctopium sulphuricum* consists of small scaly white crystals, which are astringent in taste, and which in half grain doses, produce coagulation of the saliva within the mouth.

### VISCUM. LIN.

(*Loranthaceae.*)

### XXII.—4. DIOECIA TETRANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

45. *Viscum capense*. Lin. f. A parasitical leafless shrub. Stem blunt, square, erect, articulated, smooth.

{31}------------------------------------------------

*Branches* decussate. *Flowers* dioecious, whorled, sessile. *Fruit* a globose white berry.

A parasitical shrub (called *Vogeleend*), growing on the stems of several species of *Rhus* and *Euclea*, in most parts of the colony. In its appearance and properties it is nearly allied to the European *Mistletoe*. Its stems are mucilaginous, and a little astringent. These are employed as an antispasmodic in cases of epilepsy in children and young females, where the bowels are loose, and where the disease is just commencing. It has also been recommended in St. Vitus' dance, asthma, and similar complaints, and is prescribed in the form of powder or decoction.

### VALERIANA. LIN.

(*Valerianæ.*)

### III.—1. TRIANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

46. *Valeriana capensis*. Thbg. *Root* tuberous. *Stem* herbaceous, erect, smooth. *Leaves* opposite, petiolate, 3-yoked, pinnatifid; lobes alternate, ovato-dentate, pointed; the uppermost largest. *Petioles* amplexicaul. *Flowers* corymbose, red. *Bracts* 2 opposite, setaceous.

This species is very closely allied to the European *Valeriana officinalis*. Although it may not be quite so powerful in its effects, yet it resembles the same, not only in its appearance, but also in its medical virtues. Its roots are a favourite remedy in morbid susceptibility of the nervous system, and in the form of infusion are successfully given in typhoid fevers, epilepsy, hysteria, and similar maladies. They are at the same time sudoriferous, and have a salutary effect on intestinal worms. This plant grows in moist places in many parts of the colony, and is particularly common in the George district.

### MATRICARIA. LIN.

(*Compositæ.*)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

47. *Matricaria glabrata*. D. C. *Root* annual, fibrous. *Stem* herbaceous, erect, branchy, angular. *Leaves* alternate, pinnatifid; lobes linear, entire, pointed; the upper ones toothed. *Flower-heads* terminal, solitary. Scales of the *involucre* blunt, with

{32}------------------------------------------------

a broad scarious border. *Ray* white, reflexed. *Receptacle* ovate, conical.

The *Wild Chamomile*, which, in the months of November and December, so plentifully covers the Cape Downs, is one of those plants which deserve the peculiar attention of our apothecaries. It is a *true Matricaria*, and in many respects not only equals, but even surpasses, the European species. Large sums of money are yearly expended in importing this useful and popular drug, while we can gather a plant of the same order, the same genus, and the same properties at our doors. In the more remote parts of the country, where dispensaries are not so abundantly found as in the vicinity of our metropolis, the farmers and the coloured people employ the Wild Chamomile as often, and with the same good effect, as we do the *Matricaria Chamomilla*, or the *Anthemis nobilis*. In short, this herb, which contains a superfluity of volatile oil, is an excellent antispasmodic, and most useful in colic and other spasmodic complaints, while, on account of its aromatic bitter taste, it is recommended as a stomachic in dyspepsia and in derangements of the digestive organs generally. Its local application as a resolvent is sufficiently known.

### GARULEUM. CASS.

(*Compositæ.*)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

48. *Garuleum bipinnatum*. *Less.* Suffruticose. *Roots* long, woody. *Stem* erect, striated, branchy. *Leaves* alternate, bipinnatifid; pinnæ nearly opposite, linear-lanceolate, acute. *Flower-heads* terminal, solitary; *ray* blue, *dish* yellow.

Amongst the medical indigenous plants of the Cape, the present deserves particular notice. It is well known to almost every resident as the *Snake-root*, having acquired its vernacular name from its effects as an antidote against the bites of venomous snakes,\* with which the country abounds. The root of this plant, which is a native of the Eastern districts, where it grows in the deserts of the Karroo, has a great similarity to the *Radix Senegæ* of the

---

\* The most formidable of these reptiles are the *Naja Haje Merrem.* (Cobra Capella) and the *Vipera Brachyura*. *Cuv.* (Poffadder).

{33}------------------------------------------------

Pharmacopœa. It is bitter and acid, and contains a good deal of a resinous substance, almost homogeneous to that which we observe in the root of the *Polygala Senega*. In the form of decoction or tincture, this root is a great favourite with the colonial farmer, in various diseases of the chest, asthma, and such affections where a free secretion of the mucous membrane of the lungs and bronchiæ is desirable. It also promotes perspiration, and acts as a diuretic in gout and dropsy. This valuable root ought to have a place in the *Materia medica*.

### TARCHONANTHUS. LIN.

(*Compositæ*.)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

49. *Tarchonanthus camphoratus*. *Lin*. A shrub 4-5 feet high. *Stem* erect, striated; branches angular, shaggy. *Leaves* stalked, oblong, entire, rugose, blunt, coriaceous, smooth above and tomentose beneath. *Flowers* paniculate, terminal, many-headed; *flower-stalks* short, downy.

The whole of this shrub has a camphorated odour. Its leaves, when dried, are smoked by the Hottentots and Bushmen instead of tobacco, and, like the *Dagga*, exhibit slight narcotic symptoms. In the form of infusion, they promote perspiration, and are said to be useful in spasmodic asthma.

### COTULA. LIN.

(*Compositæ*.)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

50. *Cotula multifida*. *D. C*. Herbaceous, ascending, smooth, branchy. *Leaves* semi-amplexicaul at base, pinnatifid; lobes trifid, acute. *Flower-heads* discoid, terminal, yellow. Scales of the *involucre* blunt, with a membranaceous margin.

This plant grows in the district of Uitenhage, and is used by the Hottentots (who call it *t'Kamso*) in rheumatism, scalds, and in cutaneous affections.

### ARTEMISIA. LIN.

(*Compositæ*.)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

51. *Artemisia afra*. *Jacq*. Suffrutescent. *Stem* erect, branchy. *Branches* angular, furrowed, her-

{34}------------------------------------------------

baceous, leafy. *Leaves* interruptedly bipinnatifid, stalked, smooth above and tomentose beneath; lobes linear-lanceolate, falcate. *Petioles* bearing stipules at base. *Flower-heads* peduncled, racemoso-paniculate, one-sided, hemispherical, drooping. Scales of the *involucre* ovate, lanceolate, scarious. *Recepticle* naked.

The whole of the *Wormwood* (Alsem.) has a strong, balmy smell, and a bitter, aromatic, but nauseous taste, owing to a green essential oil which it contains. The herb is tonic, antispasmodic, and anthelmintic, and very useful in debility of the stomach, visceral obstructions, jaundice, hypochondriasis, or similar evils, while its efficacy as a vermifuge is generally admitted. The best forms for using it are the infusion, the decoction, and tincture, the latter being preferred by the colonists. A strong infusion is used externally as a collyrium in weakness of the eyes, and the pounded leaves and stalks are employed as a discutient in œdema and sugillations.

### TANACETUM. LIN.

(*Compositæ.*)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

52. *Tanacetum multiflorum.* Thbg. Root woody. Stem herbaceous, angular, erect. *Branches* fastigiate, pubescent. *Leaves* alternate, rough, pinnatifid; pinnæ linear, inciso-dentate. *Capitula* terminal, corymbose, many-flowered, small, yellow.

This species, like all other plants of the same genus, contains a great deal of resin, and a specific, ethereal oil, of a very strong and peculiar odour. It has a bitter, aromatic, acrid taste, and is used as a tonic, antispasmodic, and anthelmintic, in flatulency, gout, amenorrhœa, and dropsy; but particularly for expelling lumbrici and other intestinal worms. It is administered in the form of powder or infusion, which latter promotes perspiration and acts as a mild diuretic. Applied as a fomentation, it is resolvent and anodyne, and is used also for making injections. This plant, called *Worm-kruid*, grows very abundantly in sandy soil, close to the sea-shore.

### ERIOCEPHALUS. LIN.

(*Compositæ.*)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

53. *Erioccephalus umbellulatus.* D. C. Shrubby.

{35}------------------------------------------------

*Branches* erect, one-sided, divaricating, smooth. *Leaves* fasciculate, linear, axillary, entire, silky. *Flower-heads* subterminal, stalked, corymbose. *Pedicels* somewhat longer than the capitula. *Ray-flowers* white.

This shrub (*Wild Rosemary*) inhabits the mountainous parts of the colony, and has received its colonial name on account of its smell, which somewhat resembles that of the Rosemary. According to Thunberg, it is diuretic, and used by the farmers and Hottentots in various forms of dropsy.

### HELICHRYSUM. D. C.

(*Compositæ.*)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

54. *Helichrysum nudifolium.* Less. *Root* perennial, fibrous. *Stem* single, tomentose. *Radical leaves* stalked, amplexicaul, unequal at base, ovato-lanceolate, reticulated, 5-nerved, smooth, but scabrous at the margin and on the upper surface. *Cauline leaves* narrow, lanceolate, sharp-pointed. *Capitula* terminal, corymbose, yellow. *Scales* of the *involucre* blunt.

A plant pretty common in the colony, and to be met with even in the vicinity of Cape Town, on Devil's Mountain. The whole of this plant, here called *Caffer-tea*, is demulcent, and, in the form of infusion, recommended in catarrh, phthisis, and other pulmonary affections.

55. *Helichrysum serpyllifolium.* Less. *Stem* suffrutescent. *Branches* filiform, spreading, tomentose. *Leaves* alternate, sessile, obovate, entire, blunt, somewhat curled, glabrous above and tomentose beneath. *Capitula* corymbose, conglomerated, many-flowered, white.

This species also appears to possess demulcent and emollient properties, and to be of service in the various diseases of the chest. It goes by the name of *Hottentot's tea*, and grows near the watercourses on the Cape mountains, has a pleasant smell, and is much liked by the coloured people, who infuse it as tea. Sometimes the *Helichrysum auriculatum.* Less., is used for the same purpose, and under similar circumstances.

56. *Helichrysum imbricatum.* Less. *Root* fibrous. *Stem* suffrutescent, erect. *Leaves* semi-amplexical,

{36}------------------------------------------------

ovato-oblong, apiculate and clothed, as well as the spreading branches, with white short down. *Capitula* terminal, corymbose, many-flowered, stalked; scales of the *involucre* membranaceous, imbricated, obtuse; the outer ones of a brownish hue, the inner ones snow-white at top.

Like the two former species, this likewise is recommended as a demulcent in coughs and other pulmonary affections. It is used in the form of tea, and called *Duinen-thee* (tea from the Downs). Common in the Cape Downs.

### LEONTONYX. CASS.

(*Compositæ.*)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

57. *Leontonyx augustifolius*. D. C. Covered all over with a snow-white woolly down. *Stems* suffruticose at base, branching, leafy, erect. *Leaves* sessile, linear-oblong, blunt. *Capitula* solitary. Scales of the *involucre* purple, linear, straight, pointed. D. C.

The whole of this little plant, called *Beetbosjes* by the Boers, has an aromatic smell, and when pounded and mixed with lard or fat, is applied to ulcers. Frequent in sandy soil, chiefly near St. Helena Bay and vicinity.

### ELYTROPAPPUS. CASS.

(*Compositæ.*)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

58. *Elytropappus Rhinocerotis*. Less. Shrubby. *Stem* erect, tomentose. *Branches* many, drooping. *Leaves* very small, imbricated, appressed, erect, sessile, filiform, smooth. *Capitula* racemose, 3-flowered.

A bush, called *Rhinosterboschjes*, which covers immense tracts of waste land in the Western districts. The whole of this shrub is bitter and resinous. The tops of the branches, when infused in wine or brandy, furnish a superior kind of stomachic bitters, which have a green colour, and are frequently used as a tonic in dyspepsia and other complaints, arising from impaired digestion. The tops are also given in powder to children affected with diarrhœa.

{37}------------------------------------------------

59. *Elytropappus glandulosus*. Less. Stem shrubby, downy, erect, branched. Branches aggregate, patent, very leafy. Leaves linear, acuminate, spirally twisted, bearing stalked glands on the lower surface. Capitula terminal, clustered, 2-4 flowered.

This small shrub is the *Slangenbosch* (Snake-shrub) spoken of by Thunberg (Trav. I., p. 268) as a good remedy for the expulsion of intestinal worms, when used in the shape of decoction.

### LEYSSERA. LIN.

(*Compositæ.*)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

60. *Leyssera gnaphaloides*. Lin. Root fibrous. Stem suffruticose, downy. Branches silky, nearly umbellate. Leaves aggregate, imbricato-erect, sessile, linear-subulate, furrowed, more or less tomentose, glandularly scabrous. Capitula solitary, terminal, peduncled. Involucre turbinate; its scales scarious, blunt, shining. Rays yellow.

Very few of our indigenous plants are so much in domestic use as this one, known as *Geele-bloemetjes-thee*. When pounded, or rubbed between the fingers, it gives an agreeable scent, and the infusion has a pleasant, sweetish taste. It is emollient, and for that reason is highly recommended in catarrh, cough, and even consumption. Some of our apothecaries have added this plant to the *species pectorales*.

### OSMITOPSIS. CASS.

(*Compositæ.*)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

61. *Osmitopsis asteriscoides*. Cass. Stem fruticose, erect, tomentose, little branched. Branches leafy to the apex. Leaves crowded, sessile, imbricated, lanceolate, pointed, entire, dotted, shaggy. Capitula on short pedicels, solitary, terminal, aggregate. Involucre unequal; scales ovate. Rays white, disk yellow.

A native of Table Mountain, where it grows abundantly. The whole plant, called *Bellis*, is impregnated with a great deal of an aromatic volatile oil, which, from its

{38}------------------------------------------------

odour and taste, seems to contain camphor.\* Hence its virtues as an antispasmodic, tonic, and resolvent. In the form of infusion, it is frequently and advantageously employed in cough, hoarseness, and in diseases of the chest generally, and is said to be also very serviceable in flatulent colic. Infused in spirit, it acts as a powerful external remedy, and Thunberg relates, that he has successfully cured paralysis with embrocations of the *Spiritus Bellidis*. It would be worth while to distil the essential oil, with which this plant abounds, and which, from its peculiarity, shows an affinity to cajeput-oil.

The *Osmites hirsuta*. Less., a plant common on the mountains of Fransche Hoek and Drakenstein, having a similar smell, is known in the colony as *Van der Merwe's Kruiden*.

### EURYOPS. CASS.

(*Compositæ*.)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

62. *Euryops multifidus*. D. C. Shrubby. *Stem* smooth, very branchy. *Branches* alternate, divaricating. *Leaves* glabrous, linear, entire at base, bifid or multifid above. *Peduncles* alternate, axillary, much longer than the leaves, one-headed. *Ligulae* oblong, yellow. *Achaenia* villose.

From the stem and branches of this little shrub, which grows plentifully near the Olifant's River, in the district of Clanwilliam, exudes a yellowish, semi-transparent, resinous substance, which in every respect resembles the *mastic* of the Pharmacopœia, and seems to possess almost the same properties.

The existence of this gummiferous shrub has been known for many years, and was noticed by Mr. Burchell, who in his Travels, I., p. 259, mentions it in these words:—

“The inhabitants of the Roggeveld, when in want of resin, use as a substitute a gum, which exudes from different shrubs, which they call *Harpmis-bosch* (Resin-bush) Of this gum a considerable quantity may be collected.”

---

\* A chemical analysis of this oil has since been made.<sup>1</sup> It is liquid, of a yellowish-green tint, and easily soluble in ether and alcohol. In its qualities, it resembles cajeput-oil and Borneo camphor.<sup>2</sup>

### STOBÆA. THUNB.

(Compositæ.)

### XIX.—SYNGENESIA. LIN. SYST.

63. *Stobæa rubricaulis*. D.C. Root woody. Stem erect, purple. Leaves amplexicaul, eared, rigid, smooth above, tomentose beneath, pinnatifid; lobes lanceolate, acuminate, spiny, with prickly fringes on their margin. Pedicels short, bracteate, subracemose. Scales of the involucre spreading, ovato-lanceolate, having two spines at base, which outreach the disk. Achænia downy.

The colonial name of *Graveel-wortel*, given to this plant, fully implies the nature of its effects. It is a native of the district of Swellendam, where it grows on hills and uncultivated fields. A tincture prepared from the bruised roots is diuretic, and of great service in gravel.

### LOBELLA. LIN.

(Campanulaceæ.)

### V.—1. PENTANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

64. *Lobelia pinifolia*. Lin. Stem frutescent, erect, smooth. Leaves crowded, alternate, sessile, linear-lanceolate, acute, entire, keeled. Peduncles with short bracts, silky, few-flowered. Tube of the calyx half-round. Flowers blue, subterminal, hairy outside.

The resinous root of this little shrub is stimulant and diaphoretic. A decoction of it is sometimes used as a domestic remedy in cutaneous affections, chronic rheumatism, and gout. This plant is common in the mountainous parts of the Western division of the colony, where it flowers during the greater part of the year.

### WAHLENBERGIA. SCHRAD.

(Campanulaceæ.)

### V.—1. PENTANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

65. *Wahlenbergia procumbens*. D. C. fil. Herbaceous; procumbent, diffused, entirely smooth. Leaves opposite, ovate, subsessile, blunt, entire or obsoletely crenate. Pedicels axillary, longer than the leaves.

{40}------------------------------------------------

Tube of the *calyx* egg-shaped, its lobes acute. *Flowers* erect, solitary, white.

Common about watercourses, ditches, &c., in the summer. It is an emollient, and used accordingly as an ingredient in poultices. Its smell, when dried, resembles that of *Trigonella foenum graecum*.

### STAPELIA. LIN.

(*Asclepiadeæ.*)

### V.—2. PENTANDRIA DIGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

66. *Stapelia pilifera*. *Lin.* Root fibrous. *Stem* simple or branchy, leafless, succulent, round, furrowed, tubercled; *tubercules* hair-pointed. *Flowers* stalked, solitary. *Calyx* 5 cleft; *corolla* 5 fid, its segments ovate, acuminate, patent.

The stem of this plant, which grows in the dreary wastes of the Karroo, is fleshy and of the size and form of a cucumber. It has an insipid, yet cool and watery taste, and is eaten by the natives, who call it *Guaap*, for the purpose of quenching their thirst. Infused with brandy, this plant is said to be a useful remedy for *piles*.

### GOMPHOCARPUS. R. BR.

(*Asclepiadeæ.*)

### V.—2. PENTANDRIA DYGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

67. *Gomphocarpus crispus*. *R. Br.* *Stem* erect, hispid. *Branches* alternate. *Leaves* on short petioles, subsessile, opposite, linear-lanceolate, round or subcordate at base, crisp and wavy at the margin, rigid, acuminate. *Flowers* stalked, axillary, or terminal, umbellate. *Pedicels* bracteolate, hairy. *Corolla* reflexed; *leaves* of the *corona* pointed upwards, oblong, toothed at base. *Follicles* compressed, beaked, downy. *Ribs* naked.

This plant, the *Bitter-wortel* of the farmers, is found among hilly places in the western part of the colony. The root, formerly known to the Dutch apothecaries as the *Radix Asclepiadis crispæ*, is extremely bitter and acrid, and on account of its diuretic virtues, a decoction or infusion of it has been recommended in various kinds of dropsy, and a tincture prepared of it, is said to be a valuable remedy in colic.

{41}------------------------------------------------

### DATURA. LIN (*Solanaceæ.*)

### V.—I. PENTANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

68. *Datura Stramonium.* Lin. Herbaceous. *Stem* round, branchy. *Leaves* ovate, unequally sinuate-dentate, smooth. *Flowers* large, white, funnel-shaped, plaited, axillary, solitary; *peduncles* short. *Calyx* tubular, 5-toothed, deciduous. *Stamens* 5; *style* filiform. *Capsule* fleshy, ovate, erect, prickly, 4-celled at base, 2-celled at the apex. *Seeds* numerous, kidney-shaped.

This common weed, originally a native of America, but now naturalized in most parts of the civilized world, is well known to Englishmen as the *Thorn-apple*, so named on account of its spiny fruit. Having a foetid, nauseous smell, it is called *Stinkblaren* by the Cape colonists. Every part of this plant is highly narcotic, and pharmaceutical preparations made from it require, in their administration, the greatest care and circumspection. In South Africa, the fresh warmed leaves of the plant, or the vapour of an infusion, are successfully used as a sedative in violent pains, caused by rheumatism (zinkens) or rheumatic gout. In the shape of poultices also they are applied to carcinomatous ulcers, and it is said that the smoking of the dried leaves affords great relief in spasmodic asthma.

### SOLANUM. LIN. (*Solanaceæ.*)

### V.—I. PENTANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

69. *Solanum niveum.* Thbg. *Root* perennial. *Stem* fruticose, 6 feet high, erect, snow-white, tomentose, thorny. *Branches* prickly. *Leaves* alternate, stalked, ovate, attenuate at both ends, entire, nerved. *Flowers* blue, in a lateral, decompound, panicle. *Pedicels* dichotomous, drooping. *Fruit* a red glabrous berry.

The leaves of this *Solanum* are smooth on the upper, and woolly on the lower surface. The application of the latter to foul ulcers cleanses them, and a cure is afterwards effected by applying the upper surface. Hence their Dutch name of *Geenesblären*. The fresh juice of the berries and leaves, when formed into an ointment with lard or fat, are also in use amongst the farmers for the same purpose.

{42}------------------------------------------------

70. *Solanum nigrum*. Lin. Stem and branches herbaceous, erect, angular. Leaves ovate, bluntly-toothed and waved, attenuate at base. Flowers umbellate, lateral, drooping, white. Berries globose, black.

The common *Nightshade* (*Nacht-schaduwen*) grows wild in almost all parts of the globe. It has a nauseous smell, and is slightly narcotic. In South Africa the expressed juice of the herb, and its decoction, made with fat and wax into an ointment, are often successfully employed in cleaning and healing foul ulcers.—Frequent amongst garden weeds, under walls, on dunghills, etc.

### LYPERIA. BENTH.

(*Scrophulariaceæ.*)

### XIV.—2. DIDYNAMIA ANGIOSPERMIA. LIN. SYST.

71. *Lyperia crocea*. Eckl. A little branchy shrub. Leaves very small, wedge-shaped, fasciculate, obtuse, entire, smooth. Peduncles elongated, axillary. Flowers sub-racemose, yellow. Tube of the corolla much longer than the calyx.

This bush deserves notice as a drug, and in all probability will, ere long, become an article of colonial export. It grows abundantly in some parts of the Eastern districts, whence it has found its way into the dispensary. The flowers, which are called *Geele bloemetjes*, closely resemble *Saffron* in smell and taste; they possess similar medical properties, and as an antispasmodic, anodyne, and stimulant, ought to rank with the *Crocus sativus*. Here, they have as yet been only used with success in the convulsions of children, but they deserve a more general trial. On account of the fine orange colour which they impart, they are in daily request among the Mohamedans, who use them for the purpose of dying their handkerchiefs. This drug has been observed to be sometimes adulterated by the admixture of other plants of the same genus, which are less efficacious.

### MENTHA. LIN.

(*Labiatae.*)

### XIV.—1. DIDYNAMIA GYMNOSPERMIA. LIN. SYST.

72. *Mentha capensis*. Thbg. Stem erect, 4-edged, covered all over with a white shag. Branches alternate, divaricating. Leaves opposite, sessile, subcordate

{43}------------------------------------------------

at base, linear-lanceolate, pointed, entire or often unequally toothed, hoary beneath, penninerved. *Floral leaves* awl-shaped. *Flowers* whorled, spiky. *Spikes* cylindrical, subsolitary. *Calyx* tomentose. *Corolla* white. *Stamens* longer than the corolla.

Like other *Mints*, this one contains an ethereal oil, which is sharp and bitter to the taste. It grows plentifully in moist mountainous regions, and is valued as a most excellent antispasmodic and carminative. It is used in the form of infusion in flatulent colic, meteorism, cardialgia, hysteria, and amenorrhæa, and externally to sugillations, glandular swellings, indurations, or similar complaints.

### SALVIA. LIN.

(*Labiate.*)

### II.—1. DIANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

73. *Salvia africana*. *Lin.* *Stem* shrubby, erect, 2 feet high, scabrid, very branchy. *Branches* divaricating, four-edged, shaggy. *Leaves* decussate, stalked, opposite, obovate, mucronate, serrate, wrinkled with veins, truncate at base, green above, whitish beneath. *Leaf-stalks* short, amplexicaul. *Flowers* in whorls, terminal, bracteate, peduncled. *Peduncles* opposite, short, hairy. *Bracts* 3-leaved, unequal. *Whorls* 4-6 flowered. *Calyx* campanulate villose. *Corolla* blue, hairy, double as long as the calyx. Upper lip 3-lobed, nearly entire, round; lower 2-lobed; lobes ovate, acute.

Like those of the common Sage, the leaves of this species (known as the *Wild Sage*) are fragrant, astringent, and bitter. They possess nearly the same medical properties as the *Salvia officinalis*, and are used in the same way, and under similar circumstances.

### BALLOTA. LIN.

(*Labiate.*)

### XIV.—1. DIDYNAMIA GYMNOSPERMIA. LIN. SYST.

74. *Ballota africana*. *Benth.* Shaggy. *Stem* erect, one to a foot and a half high. *Leaves* stalked, orbicular, cordate, irregularly notched. *Flowers* small,

{44}------------------------------------------------

erowed in distant axillary whorls. *Corolla* almost smooth; *bracts* awl-shaped. *Calyx* ribbed, with 10 setaceous, pointed teeth.

This plant, the whole of which is covered with soft hairs, bears an affinity to, and possesses the medical properties of the European Horehound (*Marrubium vulgare*. Lin.). It has an aromatic, bitter taste, and as a tonic, discutient, and expectorant, decoctions and infusions of its leaves are often successfully employed in chronic pulmonary diseases, obstinate coughs, and particularly in asthmatic affections. The colonists know this plant as *Katte-kruiden*\* (Cat-herbs).

### LEONOTIS. R. BR.

(*Labiatae*.)

### XIV.—1. DIDYNAMIA GYMNOSEPMIA. LIN. SYST.

75. *Leonotis Leonurus*. R. Br. *Stem* shrubby, 5 feet high. *Branches* tomentose. *Leaves* oblongo-lanceolate, whorled, obtuse, serrate from the middle to the apex, narrowed at base, slightly shaggy beneath. *Flowers* in erowed axillary whorls. *Calyx* dentate, pubescent. *Bracts* linear-lanceolate, acute, shorter than the calyx. *Corolla* tube-shaped, curved, densely hairy, bright orange, or rarely buff.

This plant, the *Wild Dagga*, is, on account of its beautiful flowers, a fine garden ornament. It grows wild in the sandy Cape Flats, and often at the roadside. It has a peculiar scent and a nauseous taste, and seems to produce narcotic effects if incautiously used. It is employed in the form of decoction in chronic cutaneous eruptions, and may be tried even in cases of leprosy. The usual dose is a wineglass-full three or four times a-day. The Hottentots are particularly fond of this plant, and smoke it instead of tobacco, and take a decoction of its leaves as a strong purgative; they likewise give it as an emmenagogue in amenorrhoea. In the Eastern districts, the *Leonotis ovata* is used for the same purpose.

---

\* In the famous trial of C. A. van der Merwe for the murder of his wife (1838), this herb has been represented (but erroneously) by a medical witness as narcotic.

{45}------------------------------------------------

### CHENOPODIUM. LIN.

(Salsolaceæ.)

### V.—2. PENTANDRIA DIGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

76. *Chenopodium ambrosioides*. Lin. Herbaceous. Stem erect, rough, branchy. Leaves stalked, oblong, narrowed at both ends, unequally sinuate-dentate, glandular beneath, upper ones linear-lanceolate, entire. Racemes leafy, glomerate, subsipicate, terminal and axillary.

The whole of this plant has a strong aromatic smell, caused by an ethereal oil which it contains, and a pungent, bitter taste. Its properties are antispasmodic, diaphoretic, and anthelmintic, and the best form for its administration is that of tea or infusion.—Grows chiefly on waste ground, under walls, by way-sides, or upon rubbish near towns and villages.

### CASSYTA. LIN.

(Laurineæ.)

### IX.—1. ENNEANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

77. *Cassyta filiformis*. Lin. Parasitical. Branches filiform, leafless, twining, having papillæ instead of roots. Perianth 6-cleft. Flowers bisexual, clustered, greenish. Fruit a red berry.

A small, twining leafless parasite, known as *Vrouwenhaar*, and common all over the colony. It is employed, but not often, as a wash in scald head, and for the destruction of vermin. Some people pretend, that it makes the hair grow.

### PROTEA. LIN.

(Proteaceæ.)

### IV.—1. TETRANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

78. *Protea mellifera*. Lin. A shrub 7—8 feet high, perfectly smooth. Stem bushy, erect. Branches purplish. Leaves lanceolate, attenuate at base, blunt, quite entire, glossy. Involucre in the axils of the branches, obovate, oblong, pink or white, scaly, imbricated. Inferior scales small, ovate, appressed; upper ones lanceolate, erect, concave, bituminous.

During the time of the inflorescence of this common, but beautiful shrub (*Suikerbosch*), the involucra or its

{46}------------------------------------------------

showy flowers are filled with a sweet, watery liquor, which is an allurement to the laborious bee, and to a host of various insects. This liquid contains a great deal of honey. It is therefore collected by many farmers, who prepare from it by inspissation, a delicious syrup, which is known as the *Syrupus Proteæ (Boschjes-stroop)*, and which is of great use in cough and pulmonary affections. The *Protea Lepidocarpon*, *R. Br.* and some other *Proteæ* also supply the same savoury juice.

### RICINUS. LIN.

(*Euphorbiaceæ.*)

### XXI.—10. MONOECIA MONADELPHIA. LIN. SYST.

79. *Ricinus lividus*. Jacq. Stem arborescent, branchy. Leaves peltate, palmated, coloured; their lobes oblong, serrato-dentate.

It is scarcely necessary to say much of a remedy so universally known as the one derived from this plant. As a mild purgative, the *Castor-oil* excels all other preparations, and is daily prescribed in all parts of the globe. It is desirable, however, that instead of importing this medicine, the colonists should prepare it themselves for exportation to those countries, where this useful plant does not grow spontaneously.

### HYÆNANCHE. LAMB.

(*Euphorbiaceæ.*)

### XXI.—9. MONOECIA POLYANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

80. *Hyænanche globosa*. Lamb. An arborescent shrub 8—10 feet high. Branches wrinkled, rifted, knotty. Leaves standing by fours on short stalks, whorled, oblong, reticulated, obtuse, leathery, quite entire, glabrous. Peduncles corymbose, axillary. Flowers monoecious.

Though the fruit of this shrub (*Wolveboon*) has not been introduced into the Materia medica of the Cape, yet it deserves particular attention. It is highly poisonous, and its four-celled nuts, when pounded, are used to destroy hyænas, or other beasts of prey, and seem to contain *Strychnium*. This fatal bush is an inhabitant of the Mas-kamma mountain, in the neighbourhood of the Olifants River.

{47}------------------------------------------------

### GUNNERA. LIN.

(Urticaceæ.)

### II.—2. DIANDRIA DIGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

81. *Gunnera perpensa*. *Lin.* Herbaceous. *Radical* leaves large, stalked, kidney-shaped, unequal, veined, obsoletely lobed, eordate at base, serro-dentate. *Petioles* elongated, compressed, streaked, hairy, as the leaves are. *Scape* tall, bearing a compound panicle of very small crowded flowers. *Fruit* a glabrous juicy berry.

This plant (*Wilde Ramanas*) grows in moist and watery parts of the colony. A decoction of the root is used by the farmers in the interior as a tonic in dyspepsia, and a tincture from it as an efficient remedy in gravel. The leaves infused as tea are said to act as a demulcent in pulmonary affections, and to cure ulcerations and wounds when applied fresh.

### PIPER. LIN.

(Piperaceæ.)

### II.—1. DIANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

82. *Piper capense*. *Lin.* Herbaceous, smooth. *Stem* erect, articulated, branchy, climbing. *Branches* geniculate, forked, one-sided, spreading. *Leaves* alternate, stalked, cordate, acute, entire, 3-nerved above, 7-nerved beneath, netted. *Nerves* downy. *Flowers* in spikes, opposed. *Spikes* peduncled, cylindric. *Fruit* a berry.

The dense forests of Swellendam and George produce a kind of pepper (*Boschpeper*), which partakes of the properties peculiar to the genus. The berries have a hot pungent taste, and an aromatic smell, and, infused in spirits, yield a tincture which is prescribed as a stomachic, stimulant, and carminative in indigestion, flatulency and colic. In appearance and taste they greatly resemble the *Cubebs*, and very likely possess similar virtues.

### WIDDRINGTONIA. ENDL.

(Coniferae.)

### XXI.—10. MONOECIA MONADELPHIA. LIN. SYST.

83. *Widdringtonia juniperoides*. *Endl.* *Branches* purplish, squarrose, twiggy. *Leaves* opposite, minute,

{48}------------------------------------------------

decussate, densely imbricate, appressed, ovate, connate, bluntly pointed, glabrous, glanduliferous. *Flowers* dioecious. *Male catkins* terminal, solitary; female ones, lateral. *Cones* globose, 4-valved; *valves* woody, erect, mucronate.

From the branches and cones of this fine tree, *Cederoom* (Cedar-tree), which grows plentifully in the mountainous regions of Clanwilliam, exudes a gum, which soon hardens in the air, becomes solid, yellowish, and transparent, and scarcely differs from the *Gummi Olibanum*, an article well known in commerce. This gum is successfully used in the form of fumigations, in gout, rheumatism, or œdematous swellings, and is also employed for the purpose of compounding plasters or preparing varnish. — *Widdringtonia cupressoides. Endl.* (Thua cupressoides Thbg.), a shrub pretty common in the neighbourhood of Cape Town, exudes the same substance.

### HOMERIA. VENT.

(*Irideæ.*)

### XVI.—1. MONADELPHIA TRIANDRIA. LIN. SYST.

84. *Homeria collina. Sweet.* Root a corm or tuberous bulb, covered with a fibrous, reticulated, hardened coat. Shaft erect, smooth, paniculately branched. Branches 2-3 flowered. Spathe 2-valved, awned. Radical-leaf, strap-shaped, narrow, caudate, concave, abruptly-pointed, outreaching the shaft. Cauline leaves 2-3 much smaller. Corolla ephemeroous, of a yellow or vermilion colour.

I introduce this plant, the *Moraea collina. Thbg.*, (which is known to almost every child in the colony as the *Cape Tulip*), not for its therapeutic use, but for its obnoxiousness. The poisonous qualities of its bulbs appear to have been known to some extent years ago, but judging from the rapidity with which death ensued in a recent case, when they had been eaten by mistake, it must be of a very poisonous kind. To Dr. LAING, Police Surgeon of Cape Town, I am indebted for the particulars of a most melancholy case of poisoning caused by this bulb.

A malay woman, somewhat advanced in years, with her three grand-children, respectively of the ages of 12, 8, and 6, partook, on the 18th September last (1850), of a supper, consisting of coffee, fish, and rice, and ate along with this,

{49}------------------------------------------------

a small basinful of the bulbs of the *Homeria collina*. The exact quantity which each ate, is not well known. They appear to have supped between 7 and 8, and retired to bed at 9 o'clock, apparently in good health.

About one in the morning the old woman awoke with severe nausea, followed by vomiting, and found the children similarly affected. She endeavoured to call for assistance, but found herself too weak to leave her bed, and when, at 5 o'clock, assistance arrived, the eldest girl was found *moribund*, and expired almost immediately. The little boy of 8 years died an hour afterwards, and the youngest child was found in a state of collapse, almost insensible, with cold extremities, pulse scarcely 50 and irregular, pupils much dilated. The symptoms of the grandmother were nearly similar, but in a lesser degree, accompanied by constant efforts at vomiting. By using diffusible stimulants, she and this child eventually recovered.

The body of the eldest child was examined twelve hours after death. Marks of intense gastritis were found, particularly about the cardiac and pyloric orifices. The inflammation extended throughout the whole course of the small intestines, and there was great venous congestion of the brain.\*

---

\* About a year after the publication of the first edition of this little work, the author received the following communication from the late RICHARD FRYER, Esq., then Justice of the Peace for Clanwilliam:--

Clanwilliam, 9th February, 1852.

Dear Sir,—On perusing your "Flora Capensis Medica" the other day, the circumstance stated at page 26, of the poisonous effects of the bulb of the "Cape Tulip," brought to my recollection a dreadful accident which occurred in Hantam, in this district, many years ago, and, as I was called upon at the time, in a judicial way, to examine some of the bodies and take evidence upon the causes of death, I can vouch for the accuracy of what I shall here relate. It appears that one of the shepherds of a farmer residing thence, brought home in the evening, a bundle of bulbs, which the Dutch call "Uyntjes;" that towards dusk these were put under the ashes to roast, and when the other servants assembled in the kitchen, they were taken out and eaten amongst them,—the party consisting of three Hottentots, two women, and one male slave. About half an hour after they had partaken of them, they were all seized with dreadful nausea, followed shortly afterwards by severe vomiting, and a speedy prostration of strength. The farmer being called, ascertained immediately from some of the bulbs still unconsumed, that they had been eating of the "*Homeria collina*," of the yellow sort. Wilde Dagga, sweet oil, milk, and everything thought good, were immediately administered, but before midnight, the three Hottentots and one woman had died, in excruciating agonies. The male slave was got through, although, for a year afterwards, he looked like a skeleton, and the surviving woman ascribed her safety to only having ate one bulb.—&c.,

{50}------------------------------------------------

It is remarkable that in cases of poisoning from *Fungi*, violent diarrhœa is present along with vomiting, whereas in the present case obstinate constipation prevailed.

Most probably, all plants belonging to this genus partake of this poisonous property, which, in the case mentioned above, was not dissipated by boiling.

### HÆMANTHUS. LIN.

(*Amaryllideæ.*)

### VI.—1. HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

85. *Hæmanthus coccineus.* *Lin.* *Root* a large tunica-ted bulb. *Radical leaves* 2, lying flat on the ground, broad, thick, coriaceous, tongue-shaped or ovate, entire, smooth. *Scape* flat, erect, coloured, bearing a densely-flowered *umbel*. *Involucre* 4-leaved, blood-red; its segments ovate. *Fruit* a red berry.

The bulb of this beautiful plant is used on account of its diuretic effects. It is cut into slices, digested in vinegar, and with the addition of honey, boiled down to the consistence of an oxymel, which is given as an expectorant and as a diuretic in asthma and dropsy. The fresh leaves are used externally as an antiseptic in foul flabby ulcers and in anthrax, and are known by the name of *Veldschoenblären*.

### GETHYLLIS. LIN.

(*Amaryllideæ.*)

### VI.—1. HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

86. *Gethyllis spiralis.* *Lin.* *Bulb* ovate, scaly, *Leaves* fascicled, upright, linear, channelled, glabrous, spirally twisted, appearing after the flower has decayed. *Flower* solitary, salver-shaped, white, spotted beneath with confluent purple dots; its *tube* very long, stalk-like, partly under ground. *Fruit* cylindrical, scented.

The elongated, club-shaped, orange-coloured fruit of this plant has a peculiar fragrance, and still preserves its old Hottentot name of *Kukumakranka*. Infused in spirits, the liquor partakes of its pleasing scent, and is employed in colic and flatulency.

{51}------------------------------------------------

### ASPARAGUS. LIN.

(Asparagineæ.)

### VI.—1. HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

87. *Asparagus laricinus*. Burch. Perennial. Stem twining, waving, smooth. Branches alternate, bent backward, armed at base and in the axils of the leaves with solitary, short, reflexed prickles. Leaves subverticillate, clustered, awl-shaped, sharp-pointed, stipulate, longer than the internodes. Peduncles 2, very slender, one-flowered, pendulous, nodulose above base. Flowers bell-shaped, patent, white, small.

The young succulent shoots of this kind of *Asparagus* furnish a most excellent dish. Its roots are *diuretic*, impart a peculiar smell to the urine, and are of service in dropsy, and in all cases where the secretion of the kidneys is scanty or anomalous

### SANSEVIERA. THBG.

(Asparagineæ.)

### VI.—1. HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

88. *Sanseviera thyrsoflora*. Thbg.\* Root horizontally creeping, jointed. Leaves radical, broad, ensiform, smooth, eoriaceous, marginate with a callous point at the apex. Scape 2 feet high, sheated at intervals by membranaceous bracts of an ovate-lanceolate form. Flowers racemoso-spicate, stalked, white, standing in pairs; anthers yellow; style lengthened, capitate.

Not uncommon in forests and on Karroo-like hills between the Zwartkops and Bosjesman Rivers (Uitenhage). Fl. Dec. Jan. In the Eastern districts; the fleshy root of this plant, when boiled, is made use of internally in piles, and is called *t'Kay* by the natives.

### ALOE. LIN.

(Asphodeleæ.)

### VI.—1. HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

89. *Aloe ferox*. Lam. Stem very lofty. Leaves perfoliate, thick, juicy, sword-shaped, deflexed, glau-

\* This species has been referred by most authors to *Sanseviera guineensis*. Willd. as a mere variety. Whether this be truly correct I cannot decide, not having had an opportunity of examining both in a fresh state.

{52}------------------------------------------------

cous, prickly throughout, but bearing larger and sharper spines along the margins. *Flowers* racemose, crowded. *Stamens* double as long as the corolla.

The Cape Aloes are procured from several species of this extensive genus, so peculiar to South Africa. The *Aloe ferox*. *Lam.*, a native of Swellendam, is generally acknowledged to yield the best extract. That obtained from the *Aloe africana*. *Mill.* is almost equally good, but not so bitter, nor so powerful as a drastic. It is the produce of the eastern districts, whence large quantities are annually exported. The Aloe commonly used by the Colonists, is prepared from the *Aloe plicatilis*. *Mill.*, whose extract is a much milder purgative, and much resembles the Barbadoes Aloes. It inhabits the mountainous range near the Paarl, Drakenstein, and Fransche Hoek. It is much to be regretted, that the farmers do not take more trouble in purifying this valuable drug.

### ORNITHOGALUM. LIN.

(*Asphodeleæ.*)

### VI.—1. HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

90. *Ornithogalum altissimum*. *Lin.* *Bulb* very large, round, tunicated. *Leaves* (appearing after the scape has withered) strap-shaped and lanceolate, convoluted-mucronate. *Scape* solitary, glaucous, racemose, elongated. *Raceme* cylindrical, lengthened, crowded with white scentless flowers.

The fleshy bulb of this plant often grows as large as a child's head. It is diuretic, and a kind of oxymel, like that obtained from the *Haemanthus coccineus*, is prepared from it, and employed as a demulcent in catarrh, asthma, consumption, and hydrothorax. It resembles the *Scilla maritima* in its effects, is common in Zwartland, where it is called *Magerman*, and may be prescribed as a substitute for Scilla.

### TULBAGHIA. THBG.

(*Asphodeleæ.*)

### VI.—1. HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

91. *Tulbaghia alliacea*. *Thbg.* *Root* fasciculated, imperfectly bulbous, fibrous. *Leaves* sheathing at base, two-rowed, strap-shaped, linear, obtuse, streaked, smooth. *Scape* simple, longer than the leaves, ending

{53}------------------------------------------------

in a loose, few-flowered umbel, surrounded by a dry 2-valved involucre. *Flowers* 6-7, on long peduncles, drooping, dark purplish. *Ferianth* double, outer-one funnel-shaped, limb 6 partite, interior 3-leaved, fleshy.

This bulbous plant has a very pungent, offensive odour, very like that of garlic, and a somewhat acrimonious taste, and has received the name of *wilde Knoflook* (wild garlic). Its bulbs, boiled in milk, are recommended in phthisis, and for expelling intestinal worms. In the eastern districts, *Tulbaghia cepacea* and *T. violacea* serve the same purpose.

### IDOTheA. KUNTH.

(*Asphodeleæ.*)

### VI.—I. HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

92. *Idothea ciliaris*. *Kth.* *Root* a scaly bulb. *Radical leaves* (appearing after the flowers have faded) strap-shaped, pointed, and fringed with short marginal hairs. *Scape* straight, spotted, smooth, much longer than the leaves. *Flowers* racemose, greenish-white; *flower-stalks* spreading.

The bulb of this plant greatly resembles that of the *Scilla maritima*; it is of a dingy, purplish colour, and its juice is so very acrid as to cause inflammation and even blisters, when applied to the skin. It is called *Jeuhbol* (itching bulb) by the Colonists, and used by them when dried, like the common Squill is in Europe, as an emetic, expectorant, and diuretic.

Found in the district of Swellendam, where it flowers in the month of September.

*Idothea elata*, *Kth.*, closely allied to this species, has the same properties, and was already known to *Breynius\** as the “Bulbus liliaceus vomitorius Capitis bonæ Spei.”

### ERIOSPERMUM. JACQ.

(*Asphodeleæ.*)

### VI.—I. HEXANDRIA MONOGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

93. *Eriospermum latifolium*. *Jacq.* *Root* tuberous, roundish, knobbed, blood-red inside. *Radical-leaf*

\* *J. Breynius* Exoticarum, aliarumque minus cognitarum plantarum Centuria. Gedani 1678. Fol. (Tab. 40.)

{54}------------------------------------------------

broad, ovate, pointed, entire, coriaceous, nervy, transversely veined, smooth, involute at base, dotted beneath, stalked. *Scape* simple, erect. streaked, racemose, many-flowered. *Flowers* pedicellate, bracteate, white.

The scarlet coloured tuber of this species, which grows on the sides of the Lion's Rump, near Cape Town and elsewhere, is very muculent, and used externally, in abrasions of the skin and in superficial ulcers. It is also employed by the Mohamcdans, in the form of decoction, in amenorrhœa. Its Cape name is *Baviaans-oren*.

### RICHARDIA. KTH.

(*Aroideæ*.)

### XXI.—I. MONOECIA ANDROGYNIA. LIN. SYST.

94. *Richardia africana*. Kth. *Root* thick, fleshy. *Leaves* radical, glossy, arrow-shaped, cordate at base, stalked; *leaf-stalks* sheathing, clasping the scape; *scape* nearly three-cornered, erect; *spathe* petal-like, hooded, covering the flower-bearing *spadix*. *Fruit* a berry.

More than a century ago, this hardy plant, the *Ethiopian Calla*, has, on account of its large, ornamental, white, cap-like spathe, been cultivated in all the gardens of Europe. In this Colony, where it is indigenous, the fresh leaves, when applied warm to parts affected with gout or rheumatism, allay the pain by producing local perspiration. The roots afford good nourishment for the porcupine (*Hystrix cristata*) *Yster-vark*, and therefore probably, this conspicuous plant has received the Cape vernacular, but ugly name of *Varkens-blaren* (pig's-leaves.)

### MOHRIA. SW.

*Filices*.

### XXIV.—CRYPTOGAMIA. LIN. SYST.

95. *Mohria thurifraga*. Sw. *Caudex* creeping, fibrous. *Stipe* filiform, hispid, erect. *Fronds* bipinnate, covered beneath with ehaffy scales. *Pinnæ* alternate, stalked; *pinnules* ovate, the upper fruit-bearing-ones, crenate; the barren-ones deeply incised.

This fern grows abundantly on the Cape Mountains. The plant, when bruised, is fragrant and smells of *Oli-*

{55}------------------------------------------------

*banum*. In some parts of the Colony, the dry leaves are pulverised, and with fat made into an ointment, which is cooling, and very serviceable in burns and scalds. The vernacular name of this plant is *Brand-boschjes*.

### LASTREA. PRESL.

(*Filices.*)

### XXIV.—CRYPTOGAMIA. LIN. SYST.

96. *Lastrea athamantica*. *Moore*. *Stipe* erect, flexuose, covered at base with long linear deciduous scales. *Fronds* leathery, smooth, lanceolate, three-pinnate. *Pinnæ* stalked, oblong, acuminate. *Primary pinnules* sessile, ovato-oblong, wedge-shaped at base, decurrent; *secondary*, sickle-shaped, oblong, blunt, veiny. *Sori* round, solitary *Involucre* kidney-shaped.

A fern, growing on grassy hills and in moist places, near Port Natal. The Zoolu Kafirs, who know it by the name of *Uncomocomo*, use it as a vermifuge, and its *caudex*, given in the form of powder, infusion, or electuary, has been proved to be excellent in helminthiasis, and especially in the cure of the tape-worm.

### ADIANTHUM. LIN.

(*Filices.*)

### XXIV.—CRYPTOGAMIA. LIN. SYST.

97. *Adianthum æthiopicum*. *Lin*. *Caudex* fibrous. *Stipe* compressed, waving, purplish. *Fronds* very delicate, transparent, decompound, smooth. *Pinnæ* alternate on capillary stalks. *Pinnules* rhomboidal, crenate at apex, traversed by forked nerves.

An infusion of this herb is sometimes used as an emollient in coughs, and in diseases of the chest. A syrup is also prepared from it, and it forms part of the *species pectorales* of the *pharmacopœia*. The Basuto Kafirs, who call this fern *Ma-o-ru-metsoo*, employ its *caudex* in the shape of decoction for promoting parturition.

### FUCOIDEÆ.

### XXIV.—CRYPTOGAMIA (ALGÆ). LIN. SYST.

98. The peculiar substance called *Iodine*, and now so universally appreciated as a powerful remedy, is

{56}------------------------------------------------

derived from the ashes or kelp of the *Fucoideæ*. With these our shores are well strewed; and amongst them are found *Algæ*, distinguished both for extraordinary frequency and gigantic size. It is certain that the *Ecklonia buccinalis*. *Hornm.* (Zee-bamboes), our *Sargassa*, *Laminariæ*, and *Iridææ*, the *Macrocytis planicaulis*. *Ag.*, the *Desmarestia herbacea*. *Lamour*, and many more of our large marine plants, would easily yield a vast quantity of *Iodine*, if the experiment of preparing it, were thought worth a due trial.

### SUHRIA. J. AG.

(*Florideæ*.)

### XXIV.—CRYPTOGAMIA (ALGÆ). LIN. SYST.

99. *Suhria vittata*. *I. Ag.* Base callous, fixed parasitically on the stems of larger *Algæ*. *Fro*nd leaf-like, linear-lanceolate, branchy, mid-ribbed at base, proliferating. *Prolifications* issuing chiefly from the margin of the frond as fringes, or in the form of small obovate leaves, which contain the fructification. *Substance* cartilaginous; colour deep purple.

Like the Carrageen, or Irish moss, the whole of this handsome sea-weed is soluble in boiling water, and transformed into a gelatinous mass. In the shape of *jelly* or *blanc mange*, it is advantageously employed in pulmonary complaints, scrofula, rickets, irritation of the bladder, &c., as a demulcent and nutritive.

Common in Table Bay, particularly on the gigantic stems of the Sea-trumpet (*Ecklonia buccinalis*. *Horn.*)

### PODAXON. DESV.

(*Fungi*.)

### XXIV.—CRYPTOGAMIA. LIN. SYST.

100. *Podaxon carcinomatis*. *Fr.* Club-shaped; *peridium* dehiscent at base. *Stipe* erect, cylindrical, white. *Cap* ovate, tapering upwards, nearly as long as the stipe.

A mushroom of an oblong club-shaped form, which grows gregariously on ant-hills. It contains a blackish powder (seeds), which is used occasionally for curing carcinomatous ulcers.

{57}------------------------------------------------

## APPENDIX. ---

I subjoin to the above enumeration of medical plants, a remedy derived from the *animal Kingdom*, one, which, if tried properly, will in all probability become an article of commerce. I allude to the

## HYRACEUM,\*

much valued by many farmers, and well known amongst them, by the rather harsh name of *Dasjespis*. Thunberg, and other travellers, mistook it for a kind of bitumen; but it is in fact the secretion of a quadruped, which is common throughout the Colony, and that lives gregariously on the rocky summits of mountains, viz., the *Klipdas* or *Hyrax capensis*. It is worthy of note that this production has baffled the researches of eminent Zoologists, who have failed from even minute dissection, in discovering any specific secretory organ, from which this matter could be derived. It may be asserted, however, that the *Hyraceum* is produced by the uropoetical system of the animal just named, and in order to explain this seeming anomaly, it must be observed that the *Hyrax* drinks very seldom, if ever. Its urine, like that of the *Hare*, is not thin and limpid, as in other quadrupeds, but thick and of a glutinous nature. From a peculiar instinct, these animals are in the habit of secreting the urine always at *one* spot, where its watery parts evaporate in the sun, while its more tenacious portions stick to the rock, and harden in the air. The fresh urine of the *Hyrax* is of a reddish tint, and this has given rise to the opinion of those, who took this production for a kind of menstrual secretion.

This substance is common on our mountains, and

---

\* Cf. *Dr L. Fikentscher*, Das Hyraceum in historischer, chemischer, pharmaceutischer, and therapeutischer Beziehung. Erlangen, 1851, Octvo.

{58}------------------------------------------------

is to be found, mixed with earth and dirt, near the caves or crevices, where these animals have their haunts.

In smell, and in its therapeutic effects, the *Hyraceum* resembles most the *Castoreum*, a remedy which is decreasing in quantity every year, and may therefore be replaced by the former. A new article of export would thus be gained. Amongst the farmers, a solution of this substance is highly spoken of as an antispasmodic in hysterics, epilepsy, convulsions of children, St. Vitus's dance; in short, in spasmodic affections of every kind.

Dr. A. BROWN, who has employed the *Hyraceum* in a great number of cases, has communicated to me the following remarks of its effects, as the result of his experience:—

*Hyraceum* is a mild stimulant and antispasmodic. The tincture, when well and properly prepared, appears to be a remedy of considerable power. It is regarded as an emmenagogue among the country people. In hysterical, nervous, and spasmodic affections, *Hyraceum*, in the form of tincture, is a very valuable remedy, and one highly deserving of trial. It is daily prescribed by myself. It is advantageously combined with the Tr. *Valerianæ*. I can speak highly of its efficacy in this class of cases. My common formula for its use is

Tinct. *Hyracei*.

„ „ *Valerianæ*.

Spir. æther sulph., two drams of each.

Aq cinnamon, two ounces.

M. D. s.—A tea-spoonful thrice a-day, or 30 drops every two or three hours.

In Epilepsy, I have also tried, and can recommend it. In spasmodic asthma, I have often derived decided advantage from a combination of equal parts of Tinctura *Hyracei* and Tinct. *Lobeliæ inflatæ*.

In a long-standing case of Hypochondria, accompanied by strong hysterical symptoms, and which had baffled myself and several other practitioners, a teaspoonful of the tincture produced a rapid and

{59}------------------------------------------------

decided cure. As an emmenagogue in amenorrhœa and chlorosis, its effects have been beyond all conception. In one case of chlorosis, where the catamenia had been absent eleven months, in another of amenorrhœa of eighteen months, and where the patient had been confined to bed for months, expectorating pus and blood, had hectic fever, cold clammy perspiration at night, complete loss of appetite, and was given up as altogether hopeless, Hyraceum effected a complete cure, for she has now for years continued fat and plump, and menstruates regularly.

In all cases where Castoreum is recommended, I have found Hyraceum far preferable as an antispasmodic; in hysteria itself, it is invaluable.

## V o r w o r t. ---

Im Jahre 1838 ersah ich aus den Göttingischen gelehrtcn Anzeigen und der Regensburger botanischen Zeitung, dass ein anonymer Freund der Botanik einen Preis für eine, auf genaue Versuche sich stützende Beantwortung der in diesem Schriftchen verhandelten Frage ausgesetzt habe, und, dass die diesen Gegenstand betreffenden Schriften vor dem ersten Januar 1840 an die Herren Professoren Bartling, Berthold oder Wöhler in Göttingen einzusenden wären.

Da ich mich davon überzeugt hielt, dass die Pflanzen allerdings unorganische Stoffe zu ihrer völligen, naturgemässen Ausbildung bedürfen, so entschloss ich mich, diese Frage, so viel als mir möglich gründlich zu beantworten, und sandte die Resultate meiner Versuche, und der Analysen meines Freundes, vor dem ersten Januar 1840, mit dem Motto; *Die diem docet!* an den Herrn Professor Bartling in Göttingen ein.

Schon frühe bewährte sich die Wahrheit des von mir gewählten Motto, denn ich ersah aus dem Stücke der Göttingischen gelehrtcn Anzeigen vom ersten Julius 1840, und aus dem 6ten Hefte des Erdmann'schen Journals für praktische Chemie, dass dieser von mir und dem Herrn Administrator Polstorff gemeinschaftlich bearbeitete Aufsatz sich des ausgesetzten Preises erfreuen würde, wenn derselbe noch durch eine genaue Analyse des zu meinen Versuchen angewandten

{75}------------------------------------------------

Sandes, und durch eine Untersuchung der Einwirkung, welche längere Zeit hindurch angewandtes kohlensäurehaltiges Wasser auf solche Silikate enthaltenden Sand ausüben, vervollständigt werde. Ferner wünschten die Herren, dass genau ausgemittelt werde, ob die Substanz der Gefäße, in denen die analysirten Pflanzen gezogen wurden, etwa auf den Gehalt derselben an unorganischen Elementen Einfluss gehabt habe, und schlugen zu dem Ende vor, schnell wachsende Pflanzen in Glasgefäßen und in Blumentöpfen von der früher benutzten Art, zum Vergleiche, vegetiren zu lassen, und einen Theil dieser Pflanzen, nebst einer Probe des zu den Versuchen angewandten Sandes, einzusenden.

Da auch diesen Wünschen und Vorschriften der Herren Preisrichter, im Laufe des verflossenen Jahres, zur Zufriedenheit derselben Genüge geleistet, und dieser Abhandlung der Preis zuerkannt ist, so übergebe ich dem geneigten Leser die Resultate der von mir und meinem Freunde angestellten Versuche und Analysen, zur bessern Uebersicht zusammen gestellt, und von einem Anhange, die Aufsaugung und Assimilirung des Extractes einer humusreichen Dammerde betreffend, begleitet.

A. F. Wiegmann.

{76}------------------------------------------------

Dies diem docet!

Seit einer langen Reihe von Jahren hielt ich mich davon überzeugt, dass die Pflanzen diejenigen unorganischen Substanzen, welche in ihrer Asche gefunden werden, von Aufsen aufnehmen, und, dass sie dieselben zu ihrer völligen, naturgemäßen Ausbildung bedürfen, als ich aus dem 101sten Stücke der Göttingischen gelehrten Anzeigen von 1838, und der 31sten Nummer der Regensburger botanischen Zeitung desselben Jahres ersah, dass ein ungenannter Freund der Wissenschaft einen Preis für die gründlichste Beantwortung der Frage:

»Ob die sogenannten unorganischen Elemente, welche in der Asche der Pflanzen gefunden werden, auch dann in den Pflanzen sich finden, wenn sie denselben von Aufsen nicht dargeboten werden; und, ob jene Elemente so wesentliche Bestandtheile des vegetabilischen Organismus sind, dass dieser sie zu seiner völligen Ausbildung durchaus bedarf«

ausgesetzt habe, und also die Gründlichkeit der erwähnten Meinung nicht als gründlich erwiesen betrachtet werde.

Alle Gewächse, die Wassergewächse nicht ausgenommen, sind entweder unmittelbar, oder doch mittelbar, an den Boden geheftet, und nehmen zum Theil die zu ihrer Erhaltung nöthigen Nahrungsmittel aus demselben auf.

Aller Boden unsers Erdkörpers ist aber erweislich ein Produkt der Verwitterung oder theilweisen Vernichtung der Gebirgsarten oder festen Steinmassen, und aller Humusgehalt desselben, welcher die Dammerde constituirt, ist das Ergebniss der Verwesung thierischer oder vegetabilischer

{77}------------------------------------------------

Körper, welche dem Boden die Stoffe, die sie aus ihm entnommen haben, wieder geben.

Die Asche der Gewächse enthält alle die unorganischen Stoffe, welche wir in dem Boden, auf welchem sie gewachsen sind, finden, und es ist wohl nicht denkbar, dass die Elementarstoffe der in der Asche der Gewächse sich befindenden unorganischen Substanzen, durch die Vegetationskraft der Pflanzen erzeugt würden, da Organismen wohl chemische Verbindungen der Elementarstoffe umwandeln, sicher aber nicht erzeugen können.

Diese Betrachtungen führten mich zu dem Schlusse: Gewiss werden die unorganischen Stoffe im aufgelösten Zustande von den Gewächsen aufgenommen, und entweder unverändert in den festen Theilen derselben abgelagert, oder durch die Vegetationskraft und die vegetabilischen Säuren in neue Verbindungen gebracht, und dabei zugleich vorherige organische Stoffe mit umgeändert.

Auch schien sich mir die Sicherheit dieses Schlusses bei fast fünfzigjähriger Pflanzenkultur völlig zu bestätigen, obgleich Manches, was mir jetzt leicht erklärlich ist, damals noch unerklärlich schien.

Durch die genauern und scharfsinnigen Arbeiten von Th. Saussure<sup>1)</sup>, John<sup>2)</sup>, Lessaigne<sup>3)</sup>, Jablonsky<sup>4)</sup>, Daubeny<sup>5)</sup> und Meyen<sup>6)</sup>, vorzüglich aber durch die Analysen und vergleichenden Versuche Carl Sprengels und später Lampadius<sup>7)</sup>, gewann ich die feste Ueberzeugung, dass die Pflanzen die unorganischen Bestandtheile, welche in ihrer Asche gefunden werden, aus dem Boden, zum Theil auch aus der Atmosphäre und

dem Regen- und Schneewasser, also von Auffeu aufnehmen, und dass jede Pflanze eine bestimmte, wenn schon nicht gleiche Menge und Mischung gewisser unorganischer Bestandtheile, zu ihrer völligen Ausbildung bedürfe.

Im Besitze fast aller über diesen Gegenstand erschienenen, sich oft vollkommen widersprechenden Schriften, las ich dieselben abermals aufmerksam durch, und glaubte zu bemerken, dass die älteren Schriftsteller zum Theil nicht mit der gehörigen Genauigkeit und Berücksichtigung der einflussreichen Umstände gearbeitet, größtentheils aber es nicht beachtet haben, dass sich in der Asche der Samen der Pflanzen dieselben unorganischen Elemente befinden, die in der Asche der Pflanzen gefunden werden, und, dass diese in den Kotyledonen aufgespeicherte Reservenahrung es ist, welche das Wachsthum der Pflanzen in einer ihrer Natur nicht angemessenen Unterlage, z. B. reinen Sand, Baumwolle, Schroot, Baryt, Schwefelblumen und dergleichen, oder auch im destillirten Wasser, bis zu einem gewissen Zeitpunkte befördert. Unbegreiflich ist es mir, wie der verehrte Schrader in Berlin, da er doch die Getreidesamen, dem damaligen Stande der Wissenschaft gemäss, so genau analysirt hat <sup>1)</sup>, nicht auf den ihm so nahe liegenden Gedanken gerathen ist, die in den Samen vorgefundenen organischen und unorganischen Stoffe, als eine in dieselben gelegte Reservenahrung zu betrachten.

Bei den Arbeiten neuerer Naturforscher vermisste ich geeignete vergleichende Versuche in einem künstlich aus verschiedenen Erden, Salzen und sogenannten humussauren Verbindungen bereiteten Boden, durch welche es sich bald ausgewiesen haben würde, dass die Pflanzen allerdings unorganische Substanzen, insofern sie in Wasser löslich sind, aus dem Boden aufnehmen, und dieselben wirklich zu ihrer völligen Ausbildung bedürfen.

Ich entschloss mich daher, auf das Versprechen meines Freundes, des Herrn Administrator Polstorff, eines

---

<sup>1)</sup> Zwei Preisschriften über die Beschaffenheit und Erzeugung der erdigen Bestandtheile von Getreidearten. Berlin 1800.

{79}------------------------------------------------

vorzüglichen und genauen Analytikers, die Asche der von mir erzogenen Pflanzen analysiren, und überhaupt alle vorfallende Analysen machen zu wollen (wozu ich mich meines hohen Alters wegen nicht mehr fähig fühle), gestützt, einige vergleichende Versuche mit der mir möglichsten Genauigkeit anzustellen, und wählte zu diesem Zwecke ökonomische Gewächse, deren Gehalt an unorganischen Bestandtheilen mir aus Sprengel's Analysen derselben bekannt war.

Aus mehreren triftigen Gründen, vorzüglich aber, um die vergleichenden Versuche mit künstlichem Ackerboden genauer anstellen zu können, wählte ich so viel als möglich chemisch reinen Quarzsand zu meinen sämtlichen Versuchen.

Wir glühten deshalb den in hiesiger Gegend, bei Königsutter vorkommenden, sehr weisen und reinen Quarzsand, zur völligen Zerstörung alles Organischen, bis zum Rothglühen; dann wurde derselbe zweimal mit einer hinlänglichen Menge verdünnter Salpeter-Salzsäure übergossen, die Masse stark umgerührt, und 16 Stunden lang warm digerirt, wodurch Kalkerde, etwas Eisenoxyd und Thonerde aufgelöst wurden. Nach dieser Operation wurde derselbe mit kochendem, destilliertem Wasser so lange ausgesüfst, bis durch die geeigneten Reagentien keine Spur von Säure oder salzsäurem Kalke, noch zu bemerken war.

Mit der Hälfte dieses gereinigten Quarzsandes wurden nun 6 grosse Blumentöpfe, 8 Zoll im Durchmesser haltend, angefüllt, und gehörig mit doppelt destilliertem, ammoniakfreiem Wasser befeuchtet.

Mit der andern Hälfte des Sandes mengte ich nach Verhältniss des Gewichtes desselben diejenigen organischen und unorganischen Substanzen, welche Carl Sprengel als Bestandtheile eines fruchtbaren Ackerbodens, in 1000 Gewichtstheilen desselben gefunden hatte, wobei ich aber durch einen früher misslungenen Versuch gewitzigt, die von Sprengel angegebene Humussäure nicht als solche, sondern mit denen nach ihrer Capazität verbundenen Basen vereinigt, zusetzte, und zwar in folgenden Verhältnissen:

{81}------------------------------------------------

Am 21. April 1839 besäete ich fünf mit dem reinen Sande, und fünf mit der künstlichen Ackererde gefüllte Töpfe, je zwei verschiedenen Inhaltes, mit 3 Grammen Wicken, eben so viel Buchweizen, Hafer, Gerste und Klee (*Trifolium pratense*), so wie am 10. Mai die beiden übrigen Töpfe verschiedenen Inhaltes, mit etwas Tabacksamen.

Bei dem Mangel eines Glashauses war es mir nicht möglich, sämtliche, mit dem reinen Sande gefüllte und besäete Töpfe durch Glasfenster vollkommen gegen den atmosphärischen Luftstaub zu schützen, und ich vermochte nur drei derselben, den mit Taback, den mit Wicken, und den mit Gerste besäeten Topf, an einen, der Morgensonne bis Mittag ausgesetzten Ort, zwischen zwei Glasfenster zu stellen. Die übrigen wurden mit feiner Gaze bedeckt an dem Ende meines Gartens, wo kein mechanisch erregter Staub zu befürchten war, unter einem Schuppen, wo sie die Morgensonne bis zum Mittage genossen, und durchaus gegen Regen geschützt waren, aufgestellt, und wenn es erforderlich war, des Abends mit doppelt destilliertem Wasser, von welchem die zuerst abgezogenen Portionen weggegossen waren, also ammoniakfreiem Wasser, begossen.

Am 5. Mai waren in sämtlichen Töpfen, sowohl in den mit Sand, als in den mit der künstlichen Ackererde gefüllten, auf dem Garten sowohl, als auch in den zwischen den Glasfenstern stehenden Töpfen, Wicken, Klee, Gersten und Hafer, und am 8. Mai auch der Buchweizen aufgelaufen.

In den ersten 8 bis 10 Tagen ihres Wachsthums verhielten sich alle aufgelaufenen Pflanzen vollkommen gleich, dann aber zeigte es sich, dass die in künstlicher Ackererde schneller und kräftiger wuchsen, und 8 Tage später, dass die Blätter derselben dunkelgrüner, als die der in dem Sande wachsenden gefärbt, auch deren heranwachsende Stengel und Halme stärker und steifer waren.

Am 20. Mai lief der in künstliche Ackererde gesäete Taback, und am 2. Junius erst der in Sand gesäete auf, und beide zeigten bis zur Entwickelung des 4. Blattes verhältnismässig gleich freudiges Wachsthum.

Seit Mitte des Junius zeigte sich aber das Wachs-

{82}------------------------------------------------

thum der Pflanzen in den verschiedenen Bodenarten so verschieden, dass ich von dieser Zeit an, das Verhältniss des Wachsthums und der Entwickelung jeder einzelnen Pflanzenspecies in jeder Bodenart besonders beschreiben muss.

### I. *Vicia sativa* hinter dem Glasfenster.

#### A. In reinem Sande.

Diese erreichte bis zum 4. Julius eine Höhe von 10 Zoll, und schien einzeln blühen zu wollen. Am 6. und 7. Julius entfalteten sich einzelne Blüthen, welche auch am 11. schon sehr kleine Schooten angesetzt hatten, die aber keine Samen enthielten, und am 15. schon verwelkt waren. Ich zog nun sämtliche Pflanzen, die unten schon gelbe Blätter zeigten, mit den Wurzeln aus dem Sande, wusch die Wurzeln mit destillirtem Wasser sorgfältig ab, trocknete und äscherte sie, nach dem später bei den Analysen der Asche zu beschreibenden Verfahren, ein.

#### B. In künstlicher Ackererde.

Diese erreichte bis zur Mitte des Junius eine Höhe von  $1\frac{1}{2}$  Fufs, so dass sie mit Reisig gestützt werden musste, blühte am 16. Junius und in der Folge üppig, worauf sie vom 26. Junius an viele gesunde Schooten ansetzte, welche am 8. August schon reife und keimfähige Samen enthielten. Sämtliche Pflanzen wurden nun, da sie unterhalb zu welken begannen, mit ihren Wurzeln aus dem Boden genommen, gewaschen, getrocknet, und wie die vorigen verbrannt und eingeäschert.

### II. *Hordeum vulgare* hinter dem Glasfenster.

#### A. In reinem Sande.

Die Gerste hatte bis zum 30. Junius, da sie unvollkommen blühte, eine Höhe von fast  $1\frac{1}{4}$  Fufs erreicht, setzte aber keine Früchte an, und im Laufe des Monats Julius wurden die Spelzen und die Spitzen der Blätter gelb, weshalb ich am ersten August sämtliche Halme

{83}------------------------------------------------

aus dem Boden zog, und sie wie die Wickenpflanzen behandelte.

#### *B. In künstlicher Ackererde.*

Diese erreichte bis zum 25. Junius, da sie vollkommen blühte, die Höhe von  $2\frac{1}{4}$  Fufs, setzte gut an, und lieferte am 10. August reifen und vollkommenen Samen, worauf die Halme sammt den Wurzeln aus dem Boden gezogen, und wie oben behandelt wurden.

### **III. Avena sativa.**

#### *A. In reinem Sande.*

Der Hafer hatte bis zum 30. Junius, da derselbe sehr unvollkommen blühte, die Höhe von fast  $1\frac{1}{2}$  Fufs erreicht, setzte aber keine Früchte an, und im Laufe des Monats Julius wurden die Spelzen und die Spitzen der Blätter, wie bei der Gerste gelb, weshalb ich die Halme ebenfalls am 1. August aus dem Boden zog, und sie wie oben behandelte.

#### *B. In künstlicher Ackererde.*

Der Hafer erreichte bis zum 28. Junius, da er vollkommen blühte, die Höhe von  $2\frac{1}{2}$  Fufs, setzte gut an und lieferte am 16. August reifen und vollständig körnigen Samen, worauf die Halme mit den Wurzeln aus dem Boden gezogen, und wie oben behandelt wurden.

### **IV. Polygonum Fagopyrum.**

#### *A. In reinem Sande.*

Der am 8. Mai aufgeläusene Buchweizen schien von allen in reinen Sand gesäten Gewächsen am besten zu gedeihen, er erreichte zu Ende des Monats Junius eine Höhe von  $1\frac{1}{2}$  Fufs, und verästelte sich bedeutend. Am 28. Junius fing er an zu blühen, blühte bis zum September, doch ohne Früchte anzusetzen, und würde sicher noch länger fortgeblüht haben, wenn ich ihn nicht

{84}------------------------------------------------

am 4. September, weil er gar zu viele Blätter verlor, aus dem Sande gezogen, und wie oben behandelt hätte.

#### B. In künstlicher Ackererde.

Der Buchweizen in diesem Boden wuchs sehr schnell, erreichte die Höhe von  $2\frac{1}{2}$  Fufs, verästelte sich so stark, dass er mit einem Stocke gestützt werden musste, fing schon am 15. Junius an zu blühen, und setzte vollkommene Samen an, die grösstentheils am 12. August schon gereift waren. Am 4. September wurde derselbe, zum Theil noch blühend und mit unreifen Früchten, weil er unten zu viel Blüthen verlor, sammt den Wurzeln aus dem Boden gezogen, und wie oben behandelt.

### V. Nicotiana Tabacum.

#### A. In reinem Sande hinter dem Glasfenster.

Der am 10. Mai gesäete Taback lief erst am 2. Junius auf, entwickelte sich aber ganz normal. Als die Pflänzchen das zweite Paar Blätter erhalten hatten, zog ich die überflüssigen heraus und ließ nur die fünf kräftigsten davon stehen, diese wuchsen sehr langsam bis zum Eintritte des Frostes im October fort, erhielten aber nicht mehr als 4 Blätter, und erreichten nur die Höhe von 5 Zoll, ohne einen Stengel zu bilden. Sie wurden am 21. October mit den Wurzeln aus dem Sande gezogen, und wie oben behandelt.

#### B. In künstlicher Ackererde.

Dieser anch am 10. Mai gesäete Taback lief schon am 22. Mai auf und wuchs kräftig. Als die Pflänzchen das zweite Paar Blätter bekommen hatten, zog ich die überflüssigen aus, und ließ nur 3 der kräftigsten stehen. Diese wuchsen freudig in die Höhe, bekamen über 3 Fufs hohe Stengel und viele Blätter, fingen am 25. Julius an zu blühen, setzten am 10. August schon Samen an, und lieferten den 8. September einzelne reife Samenkapseln mit vollkommenen Samen. Am 21. October wur-

{85}------------------------------------------------

den auch diese Pflanzen aus dem Boden gezogen, und wie oben behandelt.

### VI. *Trifolium pratense.*

#### A. In reinem Sande.

Der am 5. Mai aufgelaufene Klee wuchs im Anfange ziemlich freudig, hatte aber bis zum 15. October nur eine Höhe von  $3\frac{1}{2}$  Zoll erreicht, als seine Blätter plötzlich braun wurden, weshalb ich ihn aus dem Boden zog, und wie oben behandelte.

#### B. In künstlicher Ackererde.

Dieser hatte am 15. October die Höhe von 10 Zoll erreicht, war dunkelgrün und buschig, als ich ihn, mit dem vorigen zu vergleichen, aus dem Boden mit den Wurzeln zog, und ihn wie oben behandelte.

## Anmerkung.

Da es mir bekannt ist, dass bei vollkommen ausgebildeten Pflanzen das Verhältniss der unorganischen Bestandtheile in den verschiedenen Theilen der Pflanzen ein sehr verschiedenes ist, so, dass z. B. die Halme eines reifen Getreides mehr Kieselerde als die Samen, diese mehr phosphorsaure Talkerde - Ammoniak etc. als die Halme enthalten, habe ich, um nicht zu falschen Resultaten zu gelangen, sämmtliche Versuchspflanzen mit den Wurzeln, und wo Blüthen, Früchte und Samen waren, mit denselben verbrannt. Da durch die Samen jedesmal eine Quantität unorganischer Stoffe in den Boden gebracht wurde, so schien es uns durchaus nothwendig, die Gewichtsmenge derselben in den verschiedenen Samen kennen zu lernen, welche wir der Vegetation übergeben hatten, denn nur auf diese Weise war es möglich eine genaue Controle über die unorganischen Stoffe zu führen.

Bevor wir aber die Resultate der Analysen von den Aschen der Pflanzen mittheilen, halten wir es für nothwendig voranzuschicken welcher Methode wir uns dabei bedient haben, um:

{86}------------------------------------------------

- 1) eine von Kohle vollkommen reine Asche zu erhalten, und
- 2) den Gang anzugeben, welchen wir bei der Analyse der Asche selbst befolgten.

### I. Einäscherung der Pflanzen.

Die vollkommene Verkohlung sämtlicher Pflanzen wurde in einem bedeckten Porzellantiegel, die weitere Verbrennung der Kohle aber in einem offenen Platintiegel, vermittelst einer Berzelius'schen Glühlampe vorgenommen. Die letzteren Antheile von Kohle, welche auf diese Weise nicht mehr fortgeschafft werden konnten, wurden entfernt, indem diese noch viel Kohle enthaltende Asche in eine Glasröhre von schwer schmelzbarem Glase, wie man solche bei Elementaranalysen benutzt, gebracht wurde, dann über die zum Glühen erhitzte Asche, so lange Sauerstoff, der aus einem mit der Verbrennungsröhre verbundenen Gasometer auströmte, geleitet, bis alle Kohle vollständig verbrannt worden war. Die Kohle brannte auf diese Weise sehr leicht und vollständig weg; auch haben wir nie bemerkt, dass bei dieser Temperatur Asche und Glas auf einander eingewirkt hätten, denn nachdem die Asche mit destilliertem Wasser aus der Verbrennungsröhre fortgespült war, erschien dieselbe wie unbenutzt. Die Totalsumme des Gewichtes der Asche ergab sich durch Wägung der Verbrennungsröhre vor und nach der Verbrennung.

### II. Gang der Analyse.

Was die Aschenanalysen selbst anbelangt, so haben wir überall die Bestandtheile der Aschen durch nach einander folgende Einwirkung von destilliertem Wasser und Salzsäure in drei Gruppen gebracht, nämlich:

- a) in Wasser lösliche Substanzen,
- b) in Salzsäure lösliche Substanzen,
- c) in den Rückstand.

In der Gruppe *a* erhielten wir die Alkalien und die

{87}------------------------------------------------

damit verbundenen Säuren, und bestimmten durch Wägung des Rückstandes der verdampften Flüssigkeit nach dem Glühen desselben, die Totalsummen der darin enthaltenen Salze; weiterhin wurden dieselben nur einer qualitativen Analyse unterworfen.

Ein Aufbrausen, durch Zusatz von Salpetersäure hervorgerufen, zeigte uns das Vorhandensein von Kohlensäure an.

Durch Verdampfung der mit Salpetersäure angesäuerten Flüssigkeit zur Trockene, und abermalige Auflösung in destilliertem Wasser, wurde durch einen unauflöslichen Rückstand Kieselerde nachgewiesen.

Chlorbarium in die mit Salpetersäure angesäuerte Auflösung gebracht, zeigte uns durch Entstehung eines weissen, in Wasser und Säure unauflöslichen Niederschlages, Schwefelsäure, und ein weisser, in Salpetersäure unlöslicher, wohl aber in Aetzammoniak löslicher Niederschlag, durch salpetersaures Silberoxyd hervorgebracht, die Gegenwart von Chlor an.

Die Alkalien bestimmten wir auf die Weise, dass nachdem dieselben in schwefelsaure Salze verwandelt worden waren, die wässerige Auflösung derselben mit überchlorsaurem Baryt zersetzt, das Filtrat zur Trockniss verdampft, und das überchlorsaure Kali durch Alkohol abgeschieden wurde. Ein in Alkohol unlöslicher Rückstand gab Kali an.

Die alkoholische Flüssigkeit wurde abgedampft, der Rückstand in destilliertem Wasser gelöst, der überflüssig zugesetzte Baryt durch Schwefelsäure entfernt, filtrirt, abermals abgedampft, und so das etwa vorhandene Natron nachgewiesen.

Gruppe *b* enthielt die Salze der alkalischen Erden, der Erden und der Metalloxyde. Der in Wasser unlösliche Rückstand wurde mit Salzsäure behandelt, zur Trockniss verdampft, mit salzsäurem Wasser digerirt und durch eine Filtration die vorhandene unlösliche Kieselerde abgeschieden.

Das Totalgewicht der in Salzsäure löslichen Substanzen ergab sich alsdann nach Abzug der Gewichtsmenge von *a* und *c*.

{88}------------------------------------------------

Die Trennung der Bestandtheile dieser Gruppe geschah auf folgende Weise:

Durch Ammoniak wurde die salzsäure Auflösung derselben zerlegt:

- $\alpha$ ) in nicht fällbare, und
- $\beta$ ) in fällbare Substanzen.

In  $\alpha$ ) wurde durch oxalsaures Ammoniak Kalk, und in der davon abfiltrirten Flüssigkeit durch phosphorsaures Natron, Magnesia nachgewiesen; beide waren in der Asche als kohlensäure Salze enthalten.

Durch Essigsäure wurde  $\beta$  zerlegt:

- $\alpha\alpha$ ) in Essigsäure lösliche und
- $\beta\beta$ ) in Essigsäure unlösliche Substanzen.

$\alpha\alpha$ ) enthielt die phosphorsauren alkalischen Erden. Die abfiltrirte essigsäure Auflösung wurde mit so viel Ammoniak versetzt; dass kein bleibender Niederschlag entstand, dann mit einer Auflösung von salpetersaurem Silberoxyd versetzt; ein eigelber Niederschlag bestätigte uns die Anwesenheit der Phosphorsäure. Ein weisser Niederschlag durch oxalsaures Ammoniak hervorgebracht, liefs Kalk vermuten, und in der davon abfiltrirten Flüssigkeit erkannten wir Magnesia an dem weissen kristallinischen Niederschlage, der auf Zusatz von Ammoniak entstand.

$\beta\beta$ ) enthaltend phosphorsäure Thonerde, Eisen- und Manganoxyd, wurde mit Aetzkaliflüssigkeit gekocht, das Filtrat mit Salmiak versetzt, und durch einen etwa entstehenden weissen Niederschlag Thonerde nachgewiesen. Der nach der Einwirkung von Aetzkali gebliebene Rückstand wurde eines Theils mit Phosphorsalz vor dem Löthrohre auf Manganoxyd, anderen Theils in Salzsäure gelöst, und mittelst Kaliumeisencyanür auf Eisen geprüft.

c) Der nach der Einwirkung von Wasser und Salzsäure auf die Asche gebliebene Rückstand war Kieselerde, deren Gewicht nach dem Glühen bestimmt wurde.

Wie gros die Schwierigkeiten sind, sich eine grössere Menge einer Substanz zu verschaffen, von der man sagen könnte, sie sei chemisch rein, und verhalte sich indifferent auf das Pflanzenleben, ist zu bekannt, als dass wir nöthig hätten, solches durch Anführung von Beispielen zu erläutern.

Mit dem von uns zu den Versuchen angewandten reinen Sande, befinden wir uns aber in eben der unangenehmen Lage, denn da aller in der Natur vorkommende Sand das Resultat der Zersetzung quarziger Gesteine ist, so wird solcher stets mehr oder weniger unzersetzte Kieselverbindungen mit sich führen, und durch die Behandlung mit Salpetersalzsäure werden daraus nur die in Freiheit gesetzten Oxyde, die beigemengten kohlensäuren Verbindungen u. s. w. entfernt, während alle solche Silikate, die der Einwirkung von Salpetersalzsäure widerstehen, oder doch unvollkommen durch dieselbe zersetzt werden, wie z. B. der so sehr in den Gesteinen verbreitete Feldspath, Glimmer u. s. w., damit vermengt bleiben.

Unter unserm sogenannten reinen Sande ist also keine reine Kieselerde zu verstehen, sondern Quarzsand, noch gemengt mit solchen Silikaten, welche durch Salpetersalzsäure nicht zersetzt werden, deren Quantität, wie nachfolgende Analyse zeigt, freilich nicht sehr bedeutend, aber doch hinlänglich gewesen ist, den Ueberschuss von unorganischen Substanzen, der sich bei den ersten Versuchen ergeben hat, und eine stärkere Vegetation, als bei der Kresse in den späteren Versuchen, zu veranlassen. Deutlich scheint dieses aus der Analyse der Nicotiana, welche wir wohl die lehrreichste aller unserer Analysen nennen möchten, hervorzugehen, da der Gehalt der Asche derselben nur diejenigen Substanzen betraf, welche in dem Sande

{99}------------------------------------------------

vorhanden waren. Durch die gänzliche Abwesenheit der Schwefel- und Phosphorsäure und des Chlors, in dem erwähnten Versuche, so wie die aufgefundenen Spuren dieser Substanzen in den übrigen Versuchen überhaupt, welche hicbei einzig und allein durch die Aussaat hineingekommen sind, scheint es hinlänglich erwiesen zu sein, dass die Pflanzen nur solche unorganische Substanzen enthalten, die denselben von Aussen dargeboten werden; und ferner, dass, wenn solche unorganische Substanzen, die zu ihrer Constitution gehören, nicht in hinreichender Menge vorhanden sind, oder mit anderen Worten gesagt, wenn sie an den Processen, die während der Vegetation vorgehen, keinen hinreichenden Antheil mehr nehmen können, die Vegetation gestört wird, und die Pflanzen von diesem Punkte an, den Gesetzen der anorganischen Natur anheimfallen.

Dass unsere im Sande gezogenen Pflanzen keine, oder doch nur unvollkommene Früchte angesetzt haben, ist wohl aus dem Mangel an stickstoffhaltiger Materie, Schwefel- und Phosphorsäure, nebst Chlor, zu erklären, weil diese bei dem Fruchtbildungsprocesse eine bedeutende Rolle zu spielen scheinen.

Durch die erwähnten Wahrnehmungen, und den Wunsch der Herren Preisrichter bewogen, beschlossen wir den von uns zu den Versuchen angewandten Sand genau, wie folgt, zu analysiren.

##### 1) Quantitative Bestimmung der Kieselerde

0,5 Grammen geschlämmerter und geglühter Sand wurden mit 2,0 Grammen kohlensaurer Natron geschmolzen, die zusammengeflossene Masse in Wasser aufgeweicht, mit Salzsäure übersättigt, und zur staubigen Trockene verdampft. Der erhaltene Rückstand mit Salzsäure benetzt, und nachdem dieselbe einige Zeit hindurch eingewirkt hatte, wurde das Ganze mit destilliertem Wasser übergossen. Nachdem die Salzsäure, unterstützt durch gelinde Erwärmung, hinreichend eingewirkt hatte, wurde die erhaltene Kieselerde auf einem Filter gesammelt, mit destilliertem Wasser so lange ausgesüßt, bis salpetersaures Silber keine Reaction hervorbrachte, worauf dieselbe ge-

{100}------------------------------------------------

trocknet und geglühet wurde. Die erhaltene Kieselerde wog . . . . . I. II.  
0,489 0,49 Grammen.

Es ergiebt sich hieraus, dass in dem Sande 97,8 — 98, im Mittel also 97,9 Proc. Kieselerde und 2 — 2,2, im Mittel 2,1 Proc. andere Substanzen vorhanden sind.

Was die Reinheit der auf diese Weise erhaltenen Kieselerde betrifft, so gab sie mit einer Lösung von kohlensäurem Natron gekocht, eine vollkommene Auflösung, und vor dem Löhrohre mit Soda, eine klare Perle. Mit kohlensäurem Natron zusammengeschmolzen, vermittelst Salzsäure das entstandene kieselsäure Natron zersetzt, u. s. w., gab die abfiltrirte salzsäure Natronlösung mit Ammoniak keinen Niederschlag; sie ist mithin als rein zu betrachten.

##### 2) Qualitative Bestimmung des Alkali's.

Präparirter und geschlämpter Sand, mit der fünffachen Menge metallfreien Flussspaths gemengt, wurden mit concentrirter Schwefelsäure im Platintiegel zum Brei angerührt, anfangs gelinde erwärmt, zuletzt aber geglüht, bis alle Kiesel- und freie Schwefelsäure verflüchtigt waren. Der entstandene schwefelsäure Kalk wurde hierauf mit destillirtem Wasser ausgeläugt, und das Filtrat mit Ammoniak und oxalsäurem Ammoniak ausgefällt.

Die verdampfte Flüssigkeit gab beim Glühen einen Rückstand, der sich vollkommen in Wasser löste, durch Weinstensäure weifs, und durch Platinchlorid gelb gefällt wurde.

Bei Wiederholung des Versuchs, der auf die Weise angestellt wurde, dass als Endresultat Chlormetall erhalten wurde, ergab sich, dass das daraus gewonnene Kaliumplatinchlorid hinreichte, um alles vorhandene Alkali als Kali annehmen zu dürfen.

##### 3) Quantitative Bestimmung des Kali's.

5,0 Grammen präparirter, geschlämpter und geglühter Sand auf obige Weise behandelt, lieferten 0,031 Grammen schwefelsaures Kali = 0,32 Proc. Kali. (Bei diesem

{101}------------------------------------------------

Processe könnte der Vorwurf gemacht werden, man habe die etwa vorhandene Magnesia unberücksichtigt gelassen, allein aus den später anzuführenden Resultaten wird sich hinlänglich ergeben, dass der dadurch entstandene Fehler gleich Null ist.)

##### 4) Qualitative Bestimmung der alkalischen Erden und Metalloxyde.

Ohngefähr 200,0 Grammen präparirter und geschlämmter Sand wurden mittelst Aetzkali in einem Silbertiegel zu verschiedenen Malen aufgeschlossen, durch Salzsäure zersetzt und zur Trockene verdampft, der Rückstand mit salzsäurem Wasser digerirt, und mit Hülfe eines Filters das Lösliche von dem Unlöslichen getrennt. Um nun die große Menge von Chlorkalium möglichst zu entfernen, liessen wir dasselbe auskristallisiren, stürzten, nachdem dieses beendigt war, die ganze Masse auf einen, mit Glasscherben locker verstopften Glastrichter, um die Lauge abfließen zu lassen, spülten dieselbe mit destillirtem Wasser mehrmals ab, und machten mit der nun erhaltenen Flüssigkeit folgende Versuche.

*a)* Zu einem kleinen Theile derselben wurde Schwefelwasserstoffwasser gesetzt, wodurch eine milchige Trübung von ausgeschiedenem Schwefel entstand.

*b)* Zu einem andern Theile wurde Schwefelwasserstoffammoniak gesetzt, wodurch eine schwarze Fällung entstand.

*c)* Die übrige Lauge wurde mit destillirtem Wasser verdünnt, mit etwas Salzsäure gesäuret, und durch Ammoniak übersättigt, der entstandene braungelbe Niederschlag wurde abfiltrirt, mit Kalilauge gekocht, der rothbraune Rückstand abermals durch ein Filtrum getreunt, und das Filtrat mit Salmiak zersetzt; letzterer bewirkte eine weisse Fällung, von Alaunerde. Der von dem Kali ungelöst gebliebene rothbraune Rückstand war Eisenoxyd.

*d)* Zu einem Theile der Flüssigkeit, aus welcher Ammoniak Eisenoxyd und Thonerde gefällt hatte, wurde Schwefelwasserstoffammoniak hinzugesetzt, es entstand dadurch keine Fällung.

{102}------------------------------------------------

e) Oxalsaures Ammoniak erzeugte einen weissen Niederschlag von oxalsaurem Kalk, und in der von diesem Niederschlage abfiltrirten Flüssigkeit, brachte phosphorsaures Natron und Ammoniak, nach Verlauf einiger Zeit und nach starkem Umrühren, einen weissen kristallinischen Niederschlag von phosphorsaurer Talkerde-Ammoniak hervor.

f) Eine Auflösung von schwefelsaurem Kalk brachte zu einem andern Theile der Flüssigkeit gesetzt, keine Fällung hervor, als sie in einem verschlossenen Glase zu derselben gefügt wurde.

Chlorbariumlösung verhielt sich eben so. Salzsäure Talkerde-Ammoniaklösung gleichfalls.

Aus dieser qualitativen Untersuchung ergiebt sich, dass der Sand, außer dem bereits angeführten Kali auch Eisenoxyd, Thonerde, Kalkerde und Bittererde enthielt.

##### 5) Quantitative Bestimmung derselben.

100,0 Grammen geschlämpter und geglühter Sand wurden, wie oben erwähnt, aufgeschlossen, durch Salzsäure die Kieselerde abgeschieden, die Flüssigkeit zur Kristallisation hingestellt, und die Kristalle so lange in einem mit Glasscherben locker verstopften Glastrichter mit geringen Quantitäten destillirten Wassers abgespült, bis Ammoniak keine Fällung mehr hervorbrachte. Die erhaltene Flüssigkeit wurde nun mit doppelt kohlensäurem Kali gefällt, das gefällte Eisenoxyd und die gleichzeitig mitgefallte Alaunerde auf einem Filter gut ausgewaschen, dann in Salzsäure gelöst, die Auflösung mit überschüssigem Kali gekocht, das unlösliche Eisenoxyd auf einem Filter gesammelt, ausgewaschen, getrocknet und geglühet; es wog 0,315 Grammen.

Die Auflösung der Alaunerde in Kali wurde mit Salzsäure übersättigt, und die Alaunerde durch Ammoniak gefällt. Das Gewicht der ausgewaschenen, getrockneten und geglühten Alaunerde betrug 0,876 Grammen.

Kalk- und Talkerde wurden nun aus der von dem Eisenoxyd und der Alaunerde befreiten Flüssigkeit auf folgende Weise geschieden. Die Flüssigkeit wurde mit Salzsäure gesättigt, Ammoniak hinzugefügt und die Kalkerde

{103}------------------------------------------------

durch kleesaures Ammoniak niedergeschlagen. Der Cylinder, welcher den Niederschlag enthielt, wurde nun an einen warmen Ort gestellt, und nach 12 Stunden der kleesaure Kalk gesammelt, ausgewaschen, getrocknet, geglüht, mit wenig kohlensaurer Ammoniaklösung benetzt und abermals geglüht. Das Gewicht desselben betrug 0,86 Grammen = 0,484 Kalkerde.

Durch phosphorsaures Natron und Ammoniak wurde nun die Talkerde gefällt, der Cylinder 12 Stunden an einen warmen Ort gestellt, der Niederschlag dann gesammelt, vorsichtig ausgewaschen, getrocknet und geglüht. Der Rückstand entsprach 0,009 Grammen Bitterde.

Stellen wir nun die Resultate der quantitativen Analyse des zu den Versuchen angewandten Sandes zusammen, so finden wir, dass 100 Theile desselben bestehen aus:

|                      |              |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Kieselerde . . . . . | 97,900       |
| Kali . . . . .       | 0,320        |

| Talkerde . . . . .   | 0,009        |
|                      | <hr/> 99,904 |

Da nun durch diese Analysen erwiesen war, dass sich in dem von uns angewandten Sande noch Silikate befanden, die sich in Salpeter-Salzsäure unlöslich verhielten, blieb es uns räthselhaft, durch welches Mittel diese aufgelöst, und in unsere Versuchspflanzen gelangt waren. Nach einigem Nachdenken verfielen wir bald auf die Kohlensäure, welche mit Wasser verbunden, überall ihre zersetzende Wirkung auf die Gebirgsarten, wie ja durch die kohlensäurehaltigen Mineralwasser so deutlich bewiesen wird, bethätigt. Auch schien es uns gläublich, dass die von den Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgehanchte Kohlensäure, zu der Auflösung der erwähnten Silikate beitragen könne, und theilten diese unsere Vermuthung den Herren Preisrichtern in unserm ersten Aufsatze mit, worauf wir nach deren Aufforderung nachfolgende Versuche anstellten, um uns zu überzeugen:

{104}------------------------------------------------

1) ob die Wurzeln lebender Pflanzen Kohlensäure ausscheiden, und

2) ob die Kohlensäure die Zersetzung der Silikate bedinge. Die Aushäuchung der Kohlensäure durch die Wurzeln fanden wir mittelst eines höchst einfachen, und leicht ausführbaren Versuchs. Wir setzten nämlich einige lebende Pflanzen mit ihren unverletzten, wohl gewaschenen Wurzeln, in eine wässrige Lackmusauflösung, und liessen solche darin vegetiren. Schon nach kurzer Zeit veränderte sich die blaue Farbe des Lackmuswassers in die rothe, und durch Kochen dieser gerötheten Flüssigkeit wurde, unter Entweichung von Kohlensäurebläschen, die ursprüngliche blaue Farbe wieder hervorgebracht.

Um endlich ein möglichst deutliches Resultat von der längere Zeit dauernden Einwirkung kohlensäurehaltigen Wassers auf die, in dem zuvor mit Salpetersalzsäure behandelten Sande befindlichen Silikate zu erhalten, wurden 3 Kilogrammen dieses Sandes in einen grossen Cylinder geschüttet und mit 8 Litres destillirten Wassers übergossen. In diesen wurde nun fortdauernd, Tag und Nacht, ein Strom kohlensäurehaltigen Gases geleitet und 30 Tage lang damit fortgefahren. Nach Verlauf dieser Zeit wurde das kohlensäurehaltige Wasser von dem Sande abfiltrirt, in einem Porzellangefäße verdunstet, der erhaltene Rückstand mit Salpetersäure übergossen, wodurch Kohlensäure entwickelt wurde, und abermals bei gelinder Wärme zur Trockene verdampft. Beim Auflösen der erzeugten salpetersauren Salze blieb Kieselerde zurück. Die filtrirte Lösung zur Trockene verdampft, mit Zuckerhohle, die vollkommen verbrennlich war, vermengt und im Platintiegel verpufft, ertheilte dem damit in Berührung gebrachten und nachher abfiltrirten Wasser eine alkalische Reaction, nachdem diese durch Salzsäure aufgehoben worden war, bewirkte Platinchlorid einen gelben und Weinstinsäure einen weissen kristallinischen Niederschlag; es war mithin Kali zugegen.

Die auf dem Filter zurückgebliebene Masse wurde nun mit überschüssiger Salzsäure ausgezogen und filtrirt, wo sie dann mit Ammoniak übersättigt, einen Niederschlag von Eisenoxyd gab. Von diesem abfiltrirt erfolgte auf Zusatz von oxal-

{105}------------------------------------------------

sauarem Ammoniak ein weißer Niederschlag von oxalsäurem Kalk, und aus der davon durch ein Filter befreiten Flüssigkeit, fällte phosphorsaures Natron phosphorsaure Talkerde - Ammoniak.

Es ergiebt sich aus diesem Versuche, dass durch eine, lange Zeit anhaltende Einwirkung von kohlensäurehaltigem Wasser, auch solche Silikate zersetzt werden, die selbst der Einwirkung von Salpetersalzsäure widerstehen.

Wir haben hierbei alle die Substanzen, welche die Analyse des Sandes gab, bis auf die Thonerde, in dem kohlensäurehaltigen Wasser wieder gefunden, und glauben daher mit Bestimmtheit behaupten zu können, dass die Kohlensäure und das Wasser die Agentien sind, welche die Silikate zersetzen, und den Pflanzen in einer Verbindung zuführen, wie sie solche zu ihrer vollkommenen Entwicklung bedürfen.

Um nun endlich auszumitteln, ob die Substanz der Gefäße, in welchen die Pflanzen gezogen wurden, Einfluss auf den Gehalt derselben an unorganischen Stoffen haben könne, wurden ein im Boden durchbohrtes Glasgefäß, und ein Blumentopf derselben Masse, von welcher die zu den vorigen Versuchen angewandten waren, mit dem erwähnten, geglühten und mit Säuren behandelten Sande gefüllt, am 15. October 1840 mit Kresse besäet, zwischen zwei Fenster gestellt und mit doppelt destilliertem Wasser, wovon das zuerst abgezogene jedesmal verschüttet wurde, begossen. Die Kresse keimte den 18. October, erreichte im November die Höhe von einigen Zollen, erfror aber während meiner monatlangen Krankheit.

Am 23. April 1841 wurden beide Gefäße mit auf erwähnte Weise behandeltem Sande gefüllt, und wieder mit Kresse besäet, welche am 25. April schon keimte, aber sich ferner äußerst langsam und kümmerlich entwickelte. Erst am 28. Mai zeigten sich an einigen Pflänzchen die ersten Blüthen, und am 6. Junius bei einigen etwas derberen Pflänzchen Fruchtansätze, die jedoch größtentheils taub blieben, oder doch unvollkommene Samen enthielten; bei anderen entstanden gar keine Fruchtansätze, und die Blüthen fielen, ohne Früchte anzusetzen, ab. Die Zahl der Schötschen belief sich niemals über drei bei einem Individuo. Die

{106}------------------------------------------------

Höhe, welche die Pflänzchen in beiden Gefäßen erlangten, war sehr verschieden, von 3 bis 5 Zoll, so dass keine Pflanze die Höhe von 6 Zoll erreichte; Blätter und Blüthen waren klein und kümmerlich. Bis zum 20. Junius waren die Pflanzen gelb geworden, wurden deshalb am 21. Junius aus dem Sande gezogen, gewaschen, getrocknet, verbrannt und im Platintiegel eingeäschert.

Hundert Theile der im Glasgefässe gezogenen Kresse lieferten nach dem Verbrennen 9,54 Asche.

Hundert Theile der im Thonggefässe gezogenen Kresse lieferten nach dem Verbrennen 9,48 Asche, die wie die vorige zusammen gesetzt war.

Am Schlusse wollen wir noch eines Versuchs erwähnen, welcher unsere ausgesprochene Ansicht hinlänglich beweisen wird, dass nämlich:

1) die Vegetation eine Zeitlang auf Kosten der unorganischen Bestandtheile, welche im Samen vorhanden sind, fortdauern kann, aber aufhört, sobald ihre Quantität eine bedeutungslose Rolle zu spielen aufängt;

2) dass die unorganischen Bestandtheile der Pflanzen auf keine Weise als Produkt des Pflanzenlebens anzusehen sind, etwa gebildet aus uns unbekannten Elementarstoffen, oder als Verbindungen eigenthümlicher Art der vier bekannten Elemente, welche die organischen Körper konstituiren;

{107}------------------------------------------------

3) dass die Menge der vorhandenen unorganischen Bestandtheile der Pflanzen auch nicht durch den Lebensprocess vermehrt werde, sondern, wenn ein Hinzukommen dieser von Aussen vermieden wird, sie dann genau nur die Menge davon enthalten, welche in dem Samen vorhanden war.

Der Versuch wurde auf folgende Art angestellt. Ein Platintiegel wurde mit dem feinsten Platindrahte, welchen des Handel darbietet, angefüllt, mit destilliertem Wasser befeuchtet, und unter die obere Schicht des Drahtes 30 Samenkörner von *Lepidium sativum* gelegt. So vorgereicht wurde er auf einen Teller gesetzt, und mit einer tubulirten Glasglocke, welche unten mit Talg bestrichen war, bedeckt.

Nun wurde ein Gasgemenge, bestehend aus:

21 Maas Sauerstoff

78 Maas Stickstoff

1 Maas Kohlensäure

mithin 100 Maas künstliche atmosphärische Luft, welche sich in einem Gasometer befand, der, um dieses Gasgemenge abzukühlen, mit Eis umgeben ward, durch eine einschenkliche Glasröhre, welche mit dem Gasometer verbunden war, auf den Boden des Tellers geleitet, worauf sich der Tiegel mit den Samenkörnern befand. Es wurde nun so viel von der künstlichen atmosphärischen Luft durch destilliertes Wasser aus dem Gasometer verdrängt, als dem zehnfachen Raume der Glasglocke entsprach. Wir gaben uns nun der Meinung hin, dass durch diese kältere Luft jene wärmere und wahre atmosphärische Luft aus der Glasglocke entfernt sein dürfte. Die Oeffnung der Glasglocke wurde nun mit dem sehr gut eingeschliffenen Glasstöpsel verschlossen, und der Apparat zwischen zwei Glasfenster aufgestellt, welche unsere anderen Versuchspflanzen geborgen hatten. Vermittelst einer langen Pipette wurde ihnen das nöthige destillierte Wasser gegeben, welches freilich, da keine Verdunstung Statt fand, nur einmal nöthig war, und alle acht Tage die Luft der Glocke durch frische, von derselben Temperatur, mit Hülfe des Gasometers erneuert. Die Samen keimten nach Verlauf zweier

{108}------------------------------------------------

Tage, entwickelten später Blätter, und die Pflänzchen schie-  
nen sich ganz wohl zu befinden, erreichten eine verschie-  
dene Höhe, einige von 2, andere von 3 Zoll, während ei-  
nes Zeitverlaufs von 26 Tagen, wo sie anfangen gelb zu  
werden und abzusterben. Zwei Samenkörner hatten sich  
nicht keimfähig gezeigt. Die 28 Pflänzchen wurden nun  
aus dem Apparat genommen und getrocknet, wobei sie  
trotz der kümmerlichen Entwickelung doch ganz den der Kresse  
eigenthümlichen scharfen Geruch zeigten, darauf im Platintie-  
gel verbrannt. Sie lieferten eine Asche von 0,0025 Grammen.

28 gute Samenkörner von *Lepidium sativum* wurden  
nun ebenfalls eingeäschert, und gaben bis auf eine unbedeu-  
tende Schwankung 0,0025 Asche, also ganz dieselbe Quan-  
tität als die Pflanzen.

Caingard de la Tour, Turpin und Andere, waren durch  
ihre Arbeiten über die Gährung zu dem Schlusse geleitet,  
dass man solche für eine Vegetation halten müsse, und  
Robert Rigg machte der Königl. Akademie der Wissen-  
schaften zu London die Mittheilung, dass bei der weinig-  
ten Gährung die Quantität der unorganischen Stoffe um  
15 bis 19 mal grösser werde, als sie es vor der Gährung  
war. Letzterer machte ferner darauf aufmerksam, dass  
solches um so weniger auffallend erscheinen dürfe, wenn  
man dieses Resultat mit der Erscheinung, welche das  
Wachsthum der Pflanzen begleite, zusammenhalte. Hier-  
mit waren nun, wenn wirklich eine Vermehrung der un-  
organischen Stoffe bei der weinigsten Gährung Statt fand,  
unsere Resultate auf keine Weise in Einklang zu bringen,  
und ein prüfender Gegenversuch dieser Angabe Rigg's  
musste darüber entscheiden.

Es wurden zu diesem Zwecke 60 Grammen Zucker  
mit 5 Grammen Hefe und einer hinreichenden Menge de-  
stillirten Wassers in Gährung gebracht. Nach Vollendung  
derselben wurde die Flüssigkeit abgedampft, der Rückstand  
eingeäschert, und die kohlehaltige Asche in eine zuvor  
gewogene Glasröhre gebracht, und damit, wie bei den  
Pflanzenaschen angeführt, verfahren. Nachdem alle Kohle  
weggebrannt war, betrug die Gewichtszunahme der Glas-  
röhre 0,24 Grammen.

{109}------------------------------------------------

Dieselbe Quantität und Qualität Zucker und Hefe wurden eingeäschert, und gaben eine Gewichtszunahme der Glasröhre von 0,25 Grammen, wodurch denn die Unrichtigkeit dieser Angabe, dass bei der weinigsten Gährung eine Vermehrung der anorganischen Stoffe Statt fände, hinlänglich widerlegt zu sein scheint.

Nach diesen so eben beschriebenen, und mit der uns möglichsten Genauigkeit ausgeführten Versuchen und Analysen, scheint es uns hinlänglich erwiesen zu sein, dass die Pflanzen nicht von Wasser, Kohlensäure und Stickstoffverbindungen allein leben, und die anorganischen Stoffe, welche in der Asche gefunden worden, sich durch die Vegetationskraft aus den genannten Nahrungsmitteln bereiten, sondern, dass sie die Elementarstoffe derselben im aufgelösten Zustande aus dem Boden, zum Theil aber auch wohl durch die Blätter und blattartigen grünen Theile, als kohlensäures Gas u. s. w. aus der sie umgebenden atmosphärischen Luft, also von Aussen, aufnehmen. Die Atmosphäre enthält ja auch, außer dem Ammoniak, eine Menge anderer unorganischer Substanzen, die sich zufällig darin befinden, Salze, Erden, Säuren, Schwefel, ja selbst Metalloxyde, die mit dem Regen und Schnee auf die Gewächse und den Boden niederfallen, von den ersten sowohl durch die Blätter und blattartigen grünen Theile derselben, als vorzüglich durch deren Wurzeln aus dem Boden aufgenommen und assimilirt werden. Wie bedeutend der Gehalt der in der atmosphärischen Luft sich befindenden fremden Stoffe sein muss, kann man schon aus der Berechnung des verstorbenen Berghauptmann v. Reden zu Clausthal in dem Schweiggerschen Journal für Chemie und Physik ersehen. Dieser hat durch genaues Wägen, sowohl der zum Schmelzen bestimmten rohen Stoffe, als auch der daraus gewonnenen Producte, der Schlacken und sonstigen Rückstände, so wie den gebrauchten Feuermaterialien und deren Asche, berechnet, dass zu seiner Zeit jährlich 5,420000 Centner an vegetabilischen und animalischen Stoffen verflüchtigt und mit der Atmosphäre gemengt worden sind.

Auch ich habe in früheren Zeiten öfters Regenwas-

{110}------------------------------------------------

ser vorzüglich nach Gewittern und Höhenrauche, untersucht<sup>1)</sup>, und fast beständig Spuren eines organischen, stickstoffhaltigen Körpers (Pyrrhin?), von Salzsäure, Natron Kalkerde, und nach Gewittern von salpetersaurem Ammoniak, Phosphorsäure und Schwefel darin gefunden. Ganz kürzlich las ich auch in dem 2. Hefte des 26. Bandes des Erdmann'schen Journals für praktische Chemie einen Aufsatz des Herrn Bertels zu Regenwalde in Hinterpommern, in welchem er die Resultate seiner Untersuchungen des Regen- und Schneewassers, welches dort im Jahre 1840 vom Monat März bis zum Monat Februar 1841 gefallen ist, mittheilt, und es aufser Zweifel setzt, dass der Gehalt der atmosphärischen Luft an organischen und unorganischen Stoffen sehr bedeutend sein muss.

Ferner scheint durch die Resultate der obigen Versuche und Analysen erwiesen zu sein, dass eine gewisse Menge von unorganischen Stoffen, Salzen und Erden, selbst Metalloxyde zu der völligen, naturgemäßen Ausbildung der Gewächse durchaus nothwendig sei, wie es auch schon aus dem Gehalte der salzliebenden Pflanzen, z. B. der Salsola-Arten, der Salicornia, Glaux u. s. w., so wie dadurch, dass einige sogenannte bodenstete Pflanzen, wenn sie von dem ihrer Constitution angemessenen auf einen anderen, ihnen nicht angemessenen Boden verpflanzt worden, bald verkümmern, und zuletzt zu Grunde gehen, hervorzugehen scheint.

Der Einwurf, dass die Culturgewächse fast alle in den verschiedensten Bodenarten gedeihen, und, dass z. B. in einem botanischen Garten einige Tausende von Pflanzen im besten Gedeihen neben einander in demselben Boden stehen können, ungeachtet sie aus den verschiedensten Gegenden abstammen, und gewiss im wilden Zustande auf gänzlich verschiedenen Bodenarten wachsen, scheint mir sehr leicht beseitigt werden zu können, da eine so gemischte Dammerde, wie die Ackerkrume eines kultivirten Ackers, und die Gartenerde, vorzüglich eines botanischen Gartens, jeder Pflanzenart die ihr nöthigen Nahrungsmittel

liefern kann. Auch kömmt die relative Menge derselben wohl wenig in Betracht, da nach den Untersuchungen und Beobachtungen Sprengel's, es schon zum guten Fortkommen einer Pflanze genügt, wenn nur eine noch sorgende Menge eines, zu ihrer Constitution nothwendigen unorganischen Stoffes, der aber durchaus nicht völlig fehlen darf, in dem Boden vorhanden ist. So hat er es durch zahlreiche Versuche bestätigt gefunden<sup>1)</sup>, dass Luzerne und Esparsette, die bekanntlich auf Kalkboden am besten fortkommen, auch auf einem Boden, dessen Untergrund auf 6 Fuss Tiefe nur  $\frac{1}{5}$  Proc. Kalkerde enthält, noch vortrefflich gedeihen. Umgekehrt gedeiht die Wücherblume (*Chrysanthemum segetum*) nicht, wenn auch nur 1 Proc. Manganoxyd in dem Boden vorhanden ist.

Ob aber wirklich alle diejenigen unorganischen Stoffe, welche bei der Analyse der Pflanzenasehen gefunden werden, für das Leben der Pflanzen durchaus nöthig waren, und als Nahrungsmittel für dieselben zu betrachten sind, oder, ob die Pflanzen nicht einzelne derselben hätten entbehren können; ob die Pflanzen nicht einzelne unorganische Stoffe, die ihrer Constitution gleichgültig sind, und die sich zufällig in dem Boden befinden, also nicht als Nahrungsmittel angesehen werden müssen, zuweilen aufnehmen; und endlich, ob nicht ein anorganischer Stoff als Aequivalent für einen andern dienen könne? diese von dem Herrn Doctor Rühle in dessen vortrefflicher Dissertation<sup>2)</sup> aufgeworfenen wichtigen Fragen, in jeder Beziehung genügend zu beantworten, mögte wohl nach seinem eigenen Ausspruche kaum möglich sein, weil sich zu Gunsten einer jeden dieser Ansichten bestimmte Thatsachen anführen lassen. Indessen glaube ich davon, dass ein unorganischer Stoff bei einigen Pflanzen als ein Aequivalent eines andern dienen könne, mich überzeugt halten zu dürfen. Bekanntlich hat Cadet de Gassineourt schon vor 25 Jahren die Entdeckung gemacht<sup>3)</sup>, dass der Samen von ei-

ner auf Salzboden gewachsenen *Salsola Kali*, auf gewöhnlichem Gartenboden gesät, Pflanzen liefere, welche im ersten Jahre Kali und Natron zugleich enthalten, dass aber der Samen dieser Pflanzen im folgenden Jahre ausgesät, Pflanzen liefere, welche nur Kalisalze enthalten.

Nicht weit von der Saline Salzdahlum wohnhaft, habe ich mit dort gesammelten Samen von *Salsola Kali* diese Versuche mit dem nämlichen Erfolge nach gemacht, und dieselben auch auf die an demselben Orte wachsende *Glaux maritima* ausgedehnt.

Ich versetzte nämlich einige dieser niedlichen Pflänzchen, mit einer geringen Menge der an ihnen hängenden Erde ihres Standortes, in einen mit gewöhnlicher Gartenerde, welche nur Spuren von Chlormetallen enthält, gefüllten Blumentopf, und begoss dieselben, wenn es erforderlich war, mit destilliertem Wasser, worin sich eine geringe Menge von salzsauarem Kali aufgelöst befand. Die Pflanzen wuchsen bei dieser Behandlung äußerst üppig, blühten reichlich und nahmen binnen 10 Monaten den Topf so ein, dass sie sich über den Rand desselben weit erstreckten.

Nun versetzte ich am Ende des Monats März die Pflanzen mit der sie umgebenden Erde in meinen Garten ins freie Land, und überließ sie nun, ohne sie weiter zu begießen, ihrem ferneren Wachsthum. Sie wuchsen wieder sehr freudig, blühten auch in diesem Jahre sehr reichlich, und vermehrten sich sehr, aber in dem folgenden Jahre kränkelten sie um die Blüthezeit, blühten sehr sparsam, vermehrten sich nicht und starben im dritten Jahre zur Blüthezeit ab.

Aus diesen beiden Versuchen scheint man wohl schliessen zu dürfen, dass beide genannte Pflanzenarten, und auch wohl alle salzliebende Pflanzen, zwar Chlormetalle zu ihrer Nahrung bedürfen, dass es aber gleichgültig ist, ob das Chlor an Natrium oder Kalium gebunden ist. Auch Berthier's Analysen der Asche des Tannenholzes beweisen den ausgesprochenen Satz, dass Kali und Natron, Kalk und Magnesia, sich gegenseitig vertreten können.

Die schwierigste Frage, durch deren Lösung die an-

{113}------------------------------------------------

deren Fragen wahrscheinlich später gelöset werden könnten, ist wohl die, ob die Wurzeln der Pflanzen das Vermögen besitzen, die ihnen zu ihrer Ernährung und vollkommenen Ausbildung nothwendigen Stoffe, aus den sich ihnen darbietenden aufgelösten Substanzen des Bodens sich auswählen, und die für sie unpassenden zurückstossen, oder, wenn sie wirklich eingesogen wären, ausscheiden können.

Zwar scheint es durch viele Versuche erwiesen zu sein, dass die Wurzeln keine Wahlfähigkeit besitzen und Alles, was nur immer in Wasser aufgelöst ihnen dargeboten wird, es mag ihnen nützlich oder schädlich sein, aufnehmen, auch ist bekanntlich durch Versuche und Analysen bewiesen, dass Pflanzen selbst wirklich giftige Stoffe, wie z. B. Klee und Getreide, Kupfer und Arsenik in geringer Menge ohne allen Schaden aufnehmen können.

Nach meinen Beobachtungen ist dieses nur der Fall, wenn ihnen die Freiheit der Auswahl durch beschränkten Raum benommen worden ist, oder wenn ihre Einsaugungsorgane durch chemisch kräftige Substanzen, wie z. B. Kupfer, Arsenik und andere metallische Salze, im Uebermaasse geschwächt worden sind, wodurch die Wirkungen der Capillärkraft eintreten, und bis zum Absterben der Pflanze alles Dünnflüssige eingesogen wird.

In ihrer völligen Integrität, und wenn sie nicht durch einschliessende Gefäße, oder auf einen kleinen Raum beschränkt sind, nehmen sie keinesweges jede ihnen dargebotene Flüssigkeit, selbst nicht in Wasser aufgelöste vegetabilische Farbestoffe, sondern nur das Wasser, worin selbige aufgelöst sind, auf.

Auch die so vielfachen und sinnreichen, fünf Jahre hinter einander fortgesetzten Versuche Daubeny's <sup>1)</sup> in mannigfaltigen Unterlagen, vorzüglich in gepulvertem schwefelsauren Strontian gesäten Pflanzen von sehr verschiedenen mono- und dickotyledonischen Familien, welche mit einer schwachen Auflösung von salpetersaurem Strontian,

<sup>1)</sup> Loco citato.

{114}------------------------------------------------

bis zum Verbrauche eines Lothes desselben begossen wurden, scheinen es zu beweisen, dass Pflanzen mit unverletzten Wurzeln keine für sie unpassende Stoffe einsaugen, indem von den vielen Pflanzen dieser so zahlreichen Versuche nur drei, eine 0,1 in den Wurzeltheilen, eine in schwefelsauren Strontian gesäete 0,3, und eine dritte, in cararischen Marmor gesäete 0,4 Grau Strontian aufgesogen hatten, wozu leicht unbemerkte Umstände haben beitragen können.

So lehrt uns ja auch die Erfahrung, dass bei verschiedenen Pflanzen, welche neben einander, auf einem und demselben Boden wachsen, das Verhältniss der von ihnen aus demselben aufgenommenen Stoffe ganz verschieden ist, so, dass z. B. der auf einem Acker wachsende Hafer eine bedeutende Menge Kieselerde, der neben ihm wachsende *Rhinanthus Crista Galli* weit mehr Eisenoxyd, und die zwischen beiden wachsende *Fumaria officinalis* mehr Kali enthalten. Erscheinungen, die uns wohl berechtigen können zu schliessen, dass die Wurzeln, wenigstens in einem gewissen Grade, das Vermögen, eine Auswahl aus den, ihnen dargebotenen aufgelösten Stoffen treffen zu können, besitzen müssen, und, dass die Aufnahme der grösstentheils ihre festen Theile bildenden unorganischen Stoffe, der Art nach, durch Gesetze bestimmt wird, wiewohl die Quantität derselben, nach Umständen zuweilen verschieden ist.

Selbst der Umstand, dass wild wachsende Pflanzen nie anders, als wenn es ihnen an Wasser zur gehörigen Auflösung der ihnen nöthigen Substanzen gebricht, an Krankheiten des Ernährungssystems, welchen die kultivirten Gewächse so vielfach unterworfen sind, leiden, scheint mir für diese Ansicht zu sprechen, und Herr<sup>1)</sup> Oeconomierath Dr. Sprengel hat dieses durch einen sinnreichen Versuch, welchen derselbe in seiner Land- und Forstwissenschaftlichen Zeitschrift<sup>1)</sup> beschreibt, fast zur Gewissheit erhoben.

Da es aber nicht zu vermuten ist, dass die erwähnte

{115}------------------------------------------------

Zeitschrift sich in den Händen vieler Pflanzenphysiologen befinde, werde ich das Wichtigste aus jener Abhandlung hier mittheilen.

»Ein 18 Zoll hoher, und 14 Zoll im Durchmesser haltender Kübel, wurde von der Mitte aus, mittelst dünner Brettchen, dadurch in 6 genau schließende Fächer getheilt, dass die Brettchen, welche bis an die Oberfläche des Gefäßes reichten, nicht nur in eine kleine, in der Mitte stehende Säule, sondern auch in die Seitenwände und den Boden des Gefäßes griffen. Sämmtliche Fächer füllte er darauf mit Gartenerde an, von denen er die Erde des einen Faches mit etwas kohlensäurem Kali, die des zweiten mit etwas Knochenpulver, des dritten mit etwas Kochsalz, des vierten mit etwas Gips, des fünften mit etwas Kali, Knochenpulver und Gips mischte, die Erde des sechsten Faches aber, des Versuches wegen, unvermischt ließ. Nachdem dieses geschehen war, stellt er auf die Mitte des Kübels ein anderes, 12 Zoll hohes, und 10 Zoll im Durchmesser haltendes Gefäß ohne Boden, füllte dasselbe gleichfalls mit Gartenerde, und pflanzte in diese am 24. April eine mit vielen, an 6 Zoll langen Wurzeln versehene Pflanze des gemeinen Wiesenklee (*Trifolium pratense*). Sowohl die Erde des oberen als des unteren Gefäßes wurde während des Wachsthums der Pflanze mit Regenwasser beständig feucht erhalten, wobei er jedoch die Vorsicht gebrauchte, die Fächer des unteren Kübels niemals zu viel zu befeuchten, damit nicht vermittelst der Capillärkraft, die der Erde beigemischten Substanzen zu einander herüber geführt werden könnten. Als die Pflanze am 24. August volle 4 Monate gewachsen hatte, in welcher Zeit sie fortwährend, um sie im Wachsthum zu erhalten, von ihren Blüthenknospen befreit worden war, schlug er zuerst die Bänder des oberen Gefäßes los, nahm die einzelnen Stäbe, woraus dasselbe zusammen gesetzt war, hinweg, befreite die Wurzeln durch Wasser von der anhängenden Erde, und schnitt sie behutsam an denjenigen Stellen ab, wo sie in das untere, noch mit Erde angefüllte Gefäß drangen.

Jetzt konnte er deutlich wahrnehmen, in welchem

{116}------------------------------------------------

Fache sich sowohl die meisten, als auch die dicksten Wurzeln befanden. Das Fach, welches die Erde mit dem Knochenpulver-Zusätze enthielt, hatte die meisten und stärksten Wurzeln, während die wenigsten und feinsten sich in dem Fache befanden, wo die Erde nur Kochsalz enthielt.

Um nun das Gewicht der Wurzeln kennen zu lernen, und um zu sehen, wie weit sie sich in den verschiedenen Fächern verbreitet hätten, lösete er auch die Bänder des unteren Gefäßes, entfernte nach und nach die einzelnen Stäbe, und spülte Fach vor Fach, die Erde mit Wasser weg. Nun zeigte ihm der Augenschein, dass die Wurzeln in dem Fache, welches Knochenpulver enthielt, nicht allein den Boden des Gefäßes erreicht, sondern auch ihre Richtung wieder nach oben genommen hatten, und ein filziges Gewebe bildeten. In dem Fache, welches das Kochsalz enthielt, berührten die Wurzeln kaum den Boden, und waren nur in geringer Menge vorhanden. Die rein gewaschenen, und durch acht Tage an der Luft getrockneten Wurzeln des Faches, dessen Erde mit Knochenmehl vermischt worden war, wogen lufttrocken 3,0 Grammen, die des mit Kali gemischten 2,3 Grammen, die des mit Gips gemischten 2,0 Grammen, die des mit Kochsalz gemischten 1,1 Grammen, die des mit Kali, Knochenmehl, Kochsalz und Gips gemischten 2,2 Grammen, und die aus dem Fache mit ungemischter Gartenerde 2,5 Grammen.

Eine ähnliche Erfahrung habe ich zufällig im Frühlinge des Jahres 1822 selbst gemacht. Der verehrte Professor Weber in Kiel hatte nämlich im Herbst 1821 verschiedene Pflanzen meines Gartens, unter welchen sich nebst mehrern Arten von Aster, Mentha, Monarda und Lysimachia, auch Astragalus Cicer, Coronilla varia und Galega orientalis befanden, für den dortigen botanischen Garten bei mir bestellt, diese schlug ich bis zur Absendung an einem Orte meines Gartens ein, der durch eine Einfassung von sehr dichtem Buxbaum von dem mit Fluss-sand bedeckten, hart gewalzten Wege geschieden war, auf welchem sich aber ein kleiner Haufen gelöschten Kalkes, der von einer Reparatur des Geschirrhauses übrig geblie-

{117}------------------------------------------------

ben, und nicht weggeräumt worden war, nahe an dem Buxbaum liegend befand. Noch ehe ich sämtliche Pflanzen absenden konnte, erhielt ich die traurige Nachricht von dem Tode meines Freundes, und ließ nun die Pflanzen unbeachtet den Winter über eingeschlagen liegen. Am Ende des Monats April des folgenden Jahres, als ich die nöthigsten Gartengeschäfte schon besorgt hatte, wollte ich diese eingeschlagenen Pflanzen entlernen, und bemerkte mit Bewunderung, dass die kalkliebenden Pflanzen, *Astragalus Cicer*, *Coronilla varia* und *Galega orientalis*, ihre soboles, eine Schicht anderer Pflanzen durchsetzend, durch den Buxbaum und den harten Weg, bis ganz in die Nähe des kleinen Kalkhaufens getrieben hatten, und in dem harten Wege freudig empor wuchsen, in dem lockern Gartenboden aber nur wenige, kaum 6 Zoll lange Wurzeln getrieben hatten, dagegen die soboles der *Mentha*, *Monarda*, *Lysimachia* und *Aster*-Arten, in dem lockeren Boden weit fortgelaufen waren, und in der Nähe des Buxbaums sich nicht weiter ausgebreitet hatten.

Aus dem erwähnten Versuche des Dr. Sprengel, und meiner Beobachtung, so wie aus der allen Gärtnern bekannten Erfahrung, dass die Wurzeln der Obstbäume und vieler andern Gewächse, sich weite Strecken durch schlechtes Erdreich nach einem guten Boden hinziehen, um hier bessere, ihrer Constitution angemessene Nahrung zu finden, scheint wohl deutlich zu resultiren, dass die Pflanzen das Vermögen besitzen, vorzugsweise mit ihren Wurzeln dahin zu wachsen, wo sie eine ihrem Bedürfnisse angemessene Nahrung finden, während sie bis zu einem gewissen Grade den Boden vermeiden, welcher ein Uebermaaß eines leicht in Wasser löslichen Nahrungsstoffes enthielt.

Indessen würde man sich sehr irren, wenn man daraus zugleich schliessen wollte, dass die Pflanzen bestimmte Stoffe in bestimmter Menge aufnähmen, und eine absolute Wahlanziehung gegen anorganische Stoffe äußerten.

Aufser zahlreichen andern Erfahrungen, zeigen es die von Th. Saussure angestellten Analysen der Asche

{118}------------------------------------------------

verschiedener Gewächse von verschiedenen Standorten schon deutlich, dass bei Gewächsen derselben Art, welche auf verschiedenen Boden wachsen, nicht die Menge, sondern die Zusammensetzung derselben sehr verschieden ist. So enthielt nach seinen Analysen die Asche von Blättern des *Rhododendrum ferrugineum* auf Kalkboden gewachsen 43,25 kohlensaure Erden, und 0,75 Kieselerde, auf Kieselboden gewachsene 16,75 kohlensaure Erden, und 2,00 Kieselerde. Die Asche von Sträuchern des *Vaccinium Myrtillus* auf Kalkboden gewachsen 42,00 kohlensaure Erden, und 0,50 Kieselerde, auf Kieselboden gewachsenes 29,00 kohlensaure Erden, und 1,00 Kieselerde u. s. w.

Auch können einzelne, in Wasser leicht lösliche, den Pflanzen sonst in geringer Menge zur Nahrung dienende Stoffe, z. B. salzsäures, schwefelsäures und humussäures Kali, Natron und Ammoniak, nach Sprengel's Ausdrucke, zum relativen Gifte werden, wenn sie ihnen in gar zu grosser Menge dargeboten werden. So wird oft der Boden zu Getreide und Gemüsearten zu stark mit animalischem Dünger, besonders mit Mistjauche, gedüngt, und jene durch die grosse Menge von humussäurem Ammoniak zu Krankheiten disponirt, die ihnen fremd geblieben wären, wenn man mit gehöriger Vorsicht gedüngt hätte. Daher auch Pflanzen, welche schwefelsäure Verbindungen zu ihrer Nahrung bedürfen, nicht leicht zu viel Schwefelsäure oder Kalkerde bekommen, wenn die Schwefelsäure mit Kalkerde verbunden ist, weil der Gips zu seiner Auflösung viel Wasser erfordert. Ist dagegen die Schwefelsäure mit Eisenoxyd verbunden, so werden die Pflanzen von beiden Substanzen leicht über ihr Bedürfniss aufnehmen, da das schwefelsäure Eisen nicht allein wenig Wasser zu seiner Auflösung bedarf, sondern auch durch seine chemische Kraft die Lebenskraft der Wurzel schwächt, und zuletzt auch gänzlich vernichtet.

Die Frage, ob die Wurzeln das Vermögen besitzen, die von ihnen aufgenommenen, etwa unpassenden oder schädlichen Stoffe wieder ausscheiden zu kön-

{119}------------------------------------------------

nen, ist wohl ohne Zweifel am schwierigsten zu beantworten, da es bis jetzt noch immer an genügenden Beweisen für die Ausscheidung anderer Stoffe als der Kohlensäure, durch die Wurzeln fehlt, und dieselbe sogar in einer neueren von der medizinischen Facultät in Tübingen gekrönten Preisschrift<sup>1)</sup> gänzlich geleugnet wird.

So gewiss es auch wohl ist, dass die Wurzel, wie alle nicht grüne Theile der Gewächse, kohlensaures Gas ausscheidet, wovon ich mich selbst durch mehrere Versuche überzeugt zu haben glaube, so ist es doch meines Wissens nicht genügend erwiesen, dass sie auch andere Stoffe absondere.

Wirklich ist es auch nicht gut denkbar, dass ein und dasselbe Organ zugleich einsauge und abscheide, man müsste denn annehmen, wozu ich mich früher geneigt fühlte, dass der obere Theil der Wurzel, die Wurzelfasern (Fibrillae) für die Ausscheidung, und die Saugwurzeln (Radiculae) mit ihren Spitzen für die Einsaugung bestimmt wären, was aber noch gar nicht sicher erwiesen ist.

In Wahrheit beruhet die ganze Lehre von der Wurzelausscheidung nur auf Schlüssen, und auf unsicheren, zum Theil schon widerlegten Angaben älterer Schriftsteller, vorzüglich Plenk's und Brugmann's, und scheint nur in neuerer Zeit durch die sehr zweifelhaften Versuche von Macaire Prinsep bestätigt worden zu sein. Der Grundsatz Senebiers, dass keine Sekretion ohne Exkretion Statt finden könne, ist allerdings richtig, aber bekanntlich fehlt es ja der Pflanze, deren integrierender Theil die Wurzel ist, nicht an den mannigfaltigsten Ausscheidungen.

Eben so gegründet ist die Erfahrung, welche ich noch bei Ausziehung der Wurzeln meiner Versuchspflanzen aus dem trockenen Sande bestätigt gefunden habe, dass nämlich, wenn der Boden, in welchem die Pflanze wurzelt, auch noch so trocken ist, der Sand

{120}------------------------------------------------

oder die Erde, welche unmittelbar die Wurzel umgeben, schmierig feucht, und zusammen gebacken ist, und nur bei der grössten Trockenheit von den Wurzeln abfällt. Dieser Umstand scheint sich mir aber durch die Anziehungskraft der Saugwurzeln erklären zu lassen, ohne deshalb eine Ausscheidung flüssiger Stoffe annehmen zu müssen.

Die Versuche von Macaire Princep<sup>1)</sup>, auf welche Herr Professor Liebig<sup>2)</sup> mit Unrecht so grossen Werth legt, habe ich in den Jahren 1834 und 1838 sämtlich mit der mir möglichsten Genauigkeit, und mit denselben Pflanzen nachgemacht, habe aber gefunden, dass der grösste Theil derselben nur bei verletzten Wurzeln gelingt.

Diejenigen Versuche aber, welche für die Ansicht, dass die Wurzeln der Pflanzen die ihnen schädlichen Stoffe wieder ausscheiden können, sprechen sollen, ich meine die mit der *Mercurialis* und dem *Senecio*, von deren Wurzeln er einen Theil in eine Auflösung von essigsäurem Blei, salpetersäurem Silber oder Kochsalz, den anderen Theil aber in ein neben stehendes Gefäss mit destilliertem Wasser hatte tauchen lassen, und nach einigen Tagen die Anwesenheit der angewandten Substanzen in dem destillierten Wasser durch geeignete Reagentien nachweisen konnte, sind von mir mit den nämlichen Pflanzen, und auch mit jungen Kohlpflanzen, mehrmals angestellt worden, aber jedesmal ohne den erwarteten Erfolg, ich mochte nun viel oder wenig von den schädlichen Stoffen angewendet haben. Jedesmal zeigte es sich, dass die Saugwurzeln nach einigen Tagen verletzt waren, und anfangen schwarz zu werden und abzusterben, da denn freilich durch die Capillärkraft eine geringe Spur der angewandten schädlichen Stoffe in die Wurzeln des andern Gefäßes überging, in dem destillierten Wasser selbst aber nie eine Spur davon zu

{121}------------------------------------------------

entdecken war, so, dass ich an dem angegebenen Resultate dieser Versuche gänzlich zweifeln muss, um so mehr, als die nämlichen Versuche von dem Herrn Professor Unger mit der Lemna, und von dem Herrn Dr. Walsner mit zahlreichen Pflanzen angestellt, denselben negativen Erfolg gehabt haben.

Auch die völlig begründete Erfahrung, dass Culturgewächse selten vollkommen gedeihen, wenn sie auf demselben Boden, auf welchem das Jahr vorher Gewächse derselben Art gestanden und gereift haben, wieder gebauet worden, ja! dass nach dem Ausspruche des verdienten Landwirthes Herrn v. Schwerz, Felderbsen nicht vor dem 6. Jahre auf demselben Acker, wo sie früher gestanden und gereift (W.) haben, angebauet werden dürfen, ist ebenfalls als Wirkung der Wurzelausscheidung erklärt worden. Man hat nämlich gesagt, so wenig ein Thier auf seinen Exkrementen gedeihen könne, eben so wenig könne eine Pflanze auf den Aussonderungen ihrer Art gedeihen, die aber Pflanzen von einer anderen Familie als Nahrung und Dünger von Nutzen sein könnten.

Man hat dabei nur nicht bedacht, dass organische Stoffe durch Verwesung zerstört, unorganische aber durch das Umpflügen oder Umgraben mit den andern Substanzen des Bodens vermengt, und gewiss dadurch unschädlich gemacht werden, und endlich, wie es wohl zugehe, dass Bäume mehrere hundert, ja an tausend Jahre, auf ihrer Ausleerung gedeihen.

Viel einfacher lässt sich jene Erfahrung der Landwirthe und Gärtner dadurch erklären, dass der Boden durch die voran gegangene gereifte Frucht, der unorganischen Stoffe, welche zur Constitution des Gewächses gehören, so sehr beraubt worden sei, das eine Frucht derselben Art, selbst wenn der Boden umgeworfen, und frisch mit animalischen, nicht alle den Pflanzen dienlichen unorganischen Stoffen enthaltenden Dünger, versehen worden sei, nicht die gehörige Menge der ihr zu ihrer völligen Entwickelung nothwendigen Nahrungsmittel vorfinde. Eine Bestätigung dieser meiner Ansicht,

{122}------------------------------------------------

schcint mir aus einer in diesem Jahre gemachten Erfahrung hervorzugehen. Ich hatte nämlich ein Feld meines Gartens, welches im verflossenen Jahre Erbsen getragen hatte, und in zwei Jahren nicht mit Miste gedünget war, in diesem Frühlinge mit meinem Kompost, der alle in der Asche der Gewächse sich befindende unorganischen Substanzen, viel Humus, und etwas stickstoffhaltige Verbindungen enthält, düngen, und das Feld wieder mit Erbsen bestellen lassen. Diese wuchsen nicht allein freudig heran, sondern zeichneten sich bei der anhaltenden Dürre durch ihr frisches Ansehen, kräftigen Wuchs, und große Fruchtbarkeit vor denen meiner sämtlichen Gartennachbaren, von welchen mehrere Gemüse-Gärtner sind, aus. Auch *Centaurea benedicta* baue ich unter den nämlichen Umständen schon 2 Jahre hinter einander mit Vortheil auf demselben Felde, und zweifele nicht daran, dass man jede Culturpflanze in demselben Boden, in welchem das Jahr vorher Pflanzen derselben Art vegetirt haben, und selbst gereift sind, vortheilhaft bauen könne, wenn man nur den Boden mit denjenigen unorganischen Substanzen versorgt, welche zu der Constitution der auf demselben zu erziehenden Pflanzen gehören.

{123}------------------------------------------------

## Anhang. ---

Von vielen Pflanzenphysiologen wird bekanntlich angenommen, dass die Pflanze zu ihrem Wachsthum nicht nur der unorganischen, sondern auch der organischen Körper bedürfe, und dass namentlich unter letzteren die sogenannten humussauren Salze, Dammerdenextract, eine sehr bedeutende Rolle spielen.

De Saussure, ein eifriger Vertheidiger dieser Ansicht, hat in neuester Zeit vielfache Versuche angestellt<sup>1)</sup>, um die Richtigkeit dieser Meinung zu beweisen, und Liebig's Ansicht, nach welcher Kohlensäure, Ammoniak und Wasser, die letzten Produkte der Verwesung organisirter Körper, nebst einigen andern Mineralstoffen, namentlich alkalische Basen, die zur Erhaltung des Lebens der Pflanzen nothwendigen Stoffe sind, zu entkräften.

Wegen des sehr grossen Interesse, welches dieser Gegenstand darbietet, haben auch wir, in Bezug auf die obige Frage, einige Versuche angestellt, und erlauben uns solche anhangsweise hier mitzutheilen.

### A. Chemisches Verhalten des Humusextractes.

Der Humusextract wurde aus sogenanntem Compost (einem zwei Jahr alten Gemenge von verwesenden Vegetabilien mit Gartenerde) bereitet, indem

---

<sup>1)</sup> Froriep's neue Notizen, des 21. Bandes 21. und 22. Stück.

{124}------------------------------------------------

gleiche Theile dieses Compostes und ammoniakfreies destillirtes Wasser 24 Stunden lang hingestellt, öfter umgerührt, und die weingelbe Flüssigkeit darauf abfiltrirt wurde.

Dieser Humusextract im Wasserbade abgeraucht, zeigte in 100 Grammen einen Gehalt von 148 Milligrammen, aus organischer Materie, kohlensäurem Kalk u. s. w. bestehend.

Bringt man in eine mit Sauerstoffgas gefüllte, und mit Quecksilber gesperrte Glasröhre, Humusextract, so bemerkt man fortwährend eine langsam vor sich gehende Volumverminderung, und ein Lichterwerden der Färbung; bringt man nach Verlauf einiger Tage Kalilösung hinein, so bewirkt diese abermals eine Volumverminderung. Es ist bei diesem Versuche folglich Sauerstoffgas verschwunden, und Kohlensäure dafür gebildet worden. Geschieht solches in der atmosphärischen Luft in einem offenen Gefäße, so geht derselbe Prozess, nur langsamer, vor sich. Es bilden sich in der Flüssigkeit braune schwarze Flocken (Humuskohle) und das Gewicht der organischen Materie vermindert sich.

100 Grammen von Humusextract, welcher einen Monat hindurch dem Zutritt der atmosphärischen Luft ausgesetzt gewesen war, gaben einen Rückstand von 136 Milligrammen; es war also dadurch ein Minus von 12 Milligrammen erzeugt worden.

Dampft man Humusextract im Wasserbade mit Zusatz von etwas Salzsäure ab, so erhält man einen Rückstand, welcher mit Kalilauge übergossen, Ammoniak entwickelt. Unterwirft man den Humusextract einer Destillation, und fängt das Destillat in verdünnter Salzsäure auf, so bleibt beim Verdampfen des Destillates Salmiak als Rückstand.

Humusextract enthält mithin Ammoniak, und zwar in einem Zustande, welcher gestattet, dass solches bei erhöhter Temperatur entweichen kann, ohne Zweifel als kohlensäures Ammoniak. Dieses kohlensäure Ammoniak ist es, was höchst wahrscheinlich in alle Brunnenwasser, mehr oder weniger geführt wird

{125}------------------------------------------------

Der oft bedeutende Gehalt von Ammoniak im Brunnenwasser ist wohl niemanden bekannter als den Pharmazeuten, die oft den vierten Theil des zuerst übergangenen Destillates wegzuschütten haben, ehe sie mit Quecksilbersublimat eine klarbleibende Auflösung erhalten.

Setzt man einem solchen Brunnenwasser vor der Destillation etwas Phosphorsäure, oder auch Alaun zu, so bekommt man ein Destillat, welches weder auf Quecksilbersublimat noch auf essigsäures Blei verändernd wirkt.

Thonerdehydriat dem Humusextract hinzugefügt, verbindet sich augenblicklich mit der färbenden organischen Materie desselben, und macht solche unlöslich, die überstehende Flüssigkeit ist dann vollkommen farblos.

Vielfache Versuche haben hinreichend gelehrt, dass alle gefärbte Flüssigkeiten auf das Leben der Pflanzen stets nachtheilig einwirken, und dass Verkümmerng, ja selbst der Tod eintritt, wenn solche nicht entfernt werden. Hält man damit die eben erwähnte Eigenthümlichkeit der Thonerde, die in keiner Acker- oder Gartenerde, wo kräftige Vegetation und humusartige Stoffe sich vorfinden, gänzlich fehlt, zusammen, so scheint die Nützlichkeit, ja Nothwendigkeit derselben für das Gedeihen der Pflanzen, auf mehr als eine Art erwiesen zu sein.

Lange Zeit hindurch hat man den Nutzen der Thonerde für das Gewächsreich übersehen, bis erst in neuerer Zeit auf ihre Eigenschaft, Wasser und Ammoniak an zu ziehen, aufmerksam gemacht wurde, und wir glauben eine dritte, für das Pflanzenleben nicht minder wichtige Eigenthümlichkeit der Thonerde, in dem Unlöslichmachen der färbenden Materie, hinzufügen zu können.

### B. Vegetationsversuche im Humusextracte.

Am 18. Junius setzten wir eine 8 Zoll hohe Pflanze von *Mentha undulata* W., und eine eben so hohe Pflanze von *Polygonum Persicaria* C., beide mit vollkommen unverletzten Wurzeln, da es bei der grossen

{126}------------------------------------------------

Dürre ein Leichtes war, die Pflanzen mit der Erde aus dem Boden zu heben, ohne die Wurzeln derselben im Geringsten zu verletzen, und dann von der Erde zu befreien, in einem mit Humusextract gefüllten Cylinder. Der Cylinder wurde nun, so weit die Wurzeln im Wasser waren, um das Licht von derselben abzuhalten, mit dunkelm Papiere beklebt, und in ein Zimmer vor das Fenster gestellt. Die Pflanzen wuchsen in dem Humusextracte freudig fort, und trieben lange, sich bis zum 18. Julius weiss erhaltende Wurzeln in großer Menge. Die von denselben verbrauchte Flüssigkeit wurde gewöhnlich alle drei Tage durch destillirtes Wasser ersetzt.

Die weingelb gefärbte Flüssigkeit in dem die Pflanzen enthaltenden Cylinder wurde sichtlich heller, und war am 18. Julius ziemlich entfärbt, blieb aber beständig klar, und beide Pflanzen waren am 18. Julius um  $6\frac{1}{2}$  Zoll gewachsen und hatten mehrere Blätter getrieben. Die Mentha kam nicht zum Blühen, das Polygonum aber hatte bis zu dieser Zeit drei Blüthenähren getrieben, deren Blüthen jedoch unentwickelt abfielen.

Nachdem die Pflanzen nun also einen Monat lang in dem Humusextract gestanden hatten, zogen wir dieselben am 19. Julius aus, und dampften 100 Grammen dieser Flüssigkeit im Wasserbade zur Trockniss ab, der Rückstand derselben wog 132 Milligrammen; eine andere Portion davon mit Zusatz von Salzsäure verdampft, gab eine Entwickelung von Ammoniak nicht deutlich zu erkennen, als sie mit Aetzkalilauge versetzt wurde.

Vergleicht man nun die Gewichte der Rückstände von dem gedachten Humusextracte, so verhalten sie sich, wie folgt:

1) im frisch bereiteten Zustande 100 Gr. = 148 Milligr.

2) einen Monat lang der atmosphärischen Luft ausgesetzt „ „ = 136 „ „

3) einen Monat lang darin Pflanzen vegetirt . . . „ „ = 132 „ „  
welche Resultate mit den Ansichten Liebig's überein zu stimmen scheinen.

OBSEVATORY,  
GLASGOW, *April* 15, 1862.

MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,

I BEG most respectfully that you will take into consideration the expediency of providing for an Assistant at the Observatory of the University of Glasgow, and of appropriating a small annual sum to aid in defraying the current expenses of the same establishment.

The Observatory of the University of Glasgow is now thoroughly equipped with Instruments, and a regular course of Astronomical observations has been commenced; but in order to maintain the establishment in a proper state of efficiency, one Assistant at least is absolutely indispensable.

In support of the application herein made, permit me to submit to you the annexed Memorial relative to Astronomical Observatories in general, with especial reference to the Observatory of the University of Glasgow.

I have the honour to remain,

MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,

Your obedient Servant,

ROBERT GRANT,

*Regius Professor of Practical Astronomy  
and Observer in the University of  
Glasgow.*

To the COMMISSIONERS appointed  
by HER MAJESTY to enquire  
into the condition of the  
Universities of Scotland.

### *MEMORIAL on Astronomical Observatories in general, with especial reference to the Observatory of the University of Glasgow, addressed to the Commissioners appointed by Her Majesty to enquire into the condi- tion of the Universities of Scotland, by ROBERT GRANT, M.A., F.R.A.S., Regius Professor of Practical Astronomy and Observer in the University of Glasgow.* ---

ASTRONOMICAL Observatories consist of four distinct classes,—National Observatories, Observatories in connexion with Universities, Observatories maintained by Non-Academical Corporate Bodies, and Private Observatories. The remarks which follow relate exclusively to the two first mentioned classes, the remaining two being of less importance, besides that any allusion to them would be irrelevant to the question.

The principal National Observatories at present in a state of activity are—The Observatories of Greenwich, the Cape of Good Hope, Paris, Pulkowa, and Washington.

The Observatories in connexion with Universities are numerous, both in our own country and on the Continent.

In the British Isles there are the Observatories of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dublin. In Germany the most important are the Observatories of Berlin, Bonn, Breslau, Königsberg, Göttingen, Leipsic, Vienna, and Munich. Among

{137}------------------------------------------------

other establishments of this class on the Continent may be mentioned the Observatories of Padua, Naples, Rome, Leyden, Copenhagen, Upsala, Dorpat, and Moscow.

The Royal Observatory of Greenwich was founded in 1689, avowedly for the purpose of obtaining trustworthy observations of the heavenly bodies, which might serve as materials for the improvement of Navigation. In the subsequent conduct of the establishment, this object has on all occasions been prominently kept in view down to the present day. The operations, which may be considered as more especially comprised within the sphere of the Astronomer Royal's duties, may be thus defined:—

1st. The determination of the exact positions of the sun, moon, planets, and principal fixed stars, to serve as a groundwork for the calculations of the Nautical Almanac.

2dly. The testing of Chronometers for the use of the Royal Navy.

3dly. The transmission of correct time to various Government Establishments, and to the Shipping in the Thames and the Downs.

4thly. The tendering of advice and assistance in matters relating to the great Trigonometrical Survey of the British Isles.

The Astronomer Royal also generally acts as the adviser of the Crown in all scientific questions of a national character.

{138}------------------------------------------------

As the Director of a thoroughly equipped Observatory, the Astronomer Royal occasionally devotes attention to extra-meridional observations, but all work of this kind is maintained in stern subordination to the leading object which originally suggested the establishment of the Observatory.

The Royal Observatory of Greenwich being an essentially national establishment, the advantages which it affords for nautical or scientific purposes (in so far as those advantages are local and not common to the whole civilized world), are of course not confined to England proper, but extend to the whole British Empire. In one respect it is inadequate to meet the requirements of the object for which it was established. There is a considerable number of stars in the southern hemisphere which are extremely useful to navigators, but which cannot be seen at the Greenwich Observatory on account of its high northern latitude. It was especially with a view to the accurate determination of the positions of such objects, that the Government was induced, in the year 1829, to establish an Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.

Thus, while the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, exercises all the functions of a National Observatory, in so far as it is capable of taking cognizance of both hemispheres, the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope acts the part of an auxiliary establishment, operating in a minor field, which the Greenwich Observatory, from its geographical position, is necessarily precluded from reaching.

{139}------------------------------------------------

The Royal Observatories of Greenwich and the Cape of Good Hope being both National establishments, maintained with a view to promote the interests of Navigation, a close connexion exists between those Institutions and the Admiralty, which may be considered as their official organ of communication with Her Majesty's Government. It is generally understood that the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty exercise a preponderating influence, in so far as regards any direct control exercised by the Government, over either of those establishments.

Although the Astronomical operations, which have a direct bearing on the prosperity of the country as a great maritime power, are held to be of paramount importance at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, it is not to be inferred from this circumstance that the science of Astronomy has not been advanced by the observations made at that establishment. On the contrary, it may be confidently asserted that, during the last century and a half, the Royal Observatory of Greenwich has contributed more to the advancement of astronomy, than all the other observatories in Europe combined have done. The position of the equinoctial points, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the constants of refraction, aberration, precession and nutation, and in fact all the other fundamental elements of astronomy, rest wholly upon Greenwich observations. In the great work of the revision of the Planetary Theory in which M. Le Verrier, the eminent French astronomer, is at present engaged,

{140}------------------------------------------------

the materials which form the groundwork of his researches, consist almost exclusively of observations made at Greenwich since the middle of the last century. The vast system of the Lunar Theory is wholly based upon observations of the moon made at the same establishment. Indeed, in this department of observing astronomy, so important in its bearing on navigation, Greenwich may be said to be not only without a rival, but even without a competitor. Astronomers of all countries have been deeply impressed with the pre-eminence of Greenwich as the storehouse that has furnished the facts upon which the theories of astronomical science have been mainly established. A celebrated astronomer of the Continent has remarked that if, by some convulsion, the whole fabric of modern Astronomy were to perish, the observations of Maskelyne alone, extending over nearly half a century, would suffice for its re-construction.

The National Observatories of Paris, Pulkowa, and Washington resemble in several respects the Observatory of Greenwich, but they are establishments of much less importance.

Until recently, the observations at Greenwich may be said to have been made exclusively in the meridian. Even in the present day the number of observations made out of the meridian at that establishment, is comparatively small. Extra-meridional observations were not of much importance until Sir William Herschel, by his observations and discoveries, imparted a new aspect to Stellar Astronomy. The impulse thus

{141}------------------------------------------------

given to the department of practical astronomy, depending on observations made out of the meridian, was still further increased by the improvements effected on the Continent, during the early part of the present century, in the construction of refracting telescopes of large dimensions, mounted equatorially, and furnished with appropriate measuring apparatus.

It is only during the present century that the observatories established in connexion with universities, whether we regard the British Isles or the Continent, have exercised any influence worthy of mention, on the progress of astronomy. In 1812, the illustrious astronomer, Bessel, was appointed Professor of Astronomy in the University of Königsberg, and Director of the Observatory that had been established in connexion with the University; and from that date the Königsberg observations assumed a high degree of importance. They consisted partly of meridional, and partly of extra-meridional observations. The observations made in the meridian, related chiefly to small stars, Bessel wisely selecting a class of objects which did not come within the scope of the operations at the Greenwich Observatory.

While Bessel directed the operations at the Königsberg Observatory, he at the same time delivered a short course of lectures on astronomy in the university. This practice has been adopted generally at all observatories established in connexion with universities. The efficiency also which Bessel introduced at the Königsberg Observatory gradually

{142}------------------------------------------------

extended to most of the other university observatories established both on the Continent and in the British Isles.

The observations made at university observatories, mainly derive their value from the circumstance of their being, to a great extent, extra-meridional. Such observations are, generally speaking, of more immediate application than those made in the meridian, and at the same time conflict less with the operations at Greenwich, and other great national observatories. They are also attended with the advantage that they may be laid aside at any time, and subsequently resumed without any inconvenience. With a view to the prosecution of observations out of the meridian, *all* the observatories on the Continent which are connected with universities, and also the observatories of Oxford and Cambridge, are furnished with equatorially mounted telescopes, adapted to making accurate measures. The defect under which the Glasgow Observatory laboured in this respect, will be effectively remedied in the course of a few months, a powerful instrument of this class having been recently purchased for the establishment.

The four British Academic Observatories of Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, if arranged in the order of the date of their original establishment, would stand thus:—

| OBSERVATORY.   | DATE OF<br>ESTABLISHMENT. | IN WHOM THE RIGHT OF APPOINTING<br>THE OBSERVER IS VESTED. |

{143}------------------------------------------------

The Oxford Observatory continued to be totally inefficient for purposes connected with the advancement of astronomy until the year 1840, when, the late Mr. Johnson having been appointed Director of the establishment, a systematic course of observations was commenced, which has been since maintained without interruption.

The Cambridge Observatory is entitled to the honour of having been the first academic observatory of the British Isles which assumed the position of a useful scientific establishment. This occurred in the year 1827, when Mr. Airy, now Astronomer Royal, was appointed Plumian Professor of Astronomy, and Director of the Observatory. A course of observations adapted to the advancement of Astronomy was commenced in that year, and has since been regularly prosecuted down to the present day.

The establishment of the Edinburgh Observatory originated in a desire to place the Chair of Practical Astronomy in the University of Edinburgh on an efficient footing. This Chair was founded in the year 1786 by the Crown, which bestowed on the occupant a salary of one hundred pounds a year. There was no Observatory connected with the Chair, nor had the Professor of Practical Astronomy any other official source of income than the small salary just mentioned, and the fees which he might receive from lecturing at the College. As the income derived from fees was merely nominal, the course of lectures was discontinued, and the Chair fell into the condition of a

{144}------------------------------------------------

sinecure, till the death of Dr. Blair, in 1828, when steps were taken for placing it in an efficient state, by establishing an astronomical observatory in connexion with it. This was effected in 1834, by the Government purchasing the Observatory which had been erected on the Calton Hill, supplying it with suitable meridional instruments, and appointing the Professor of Practical Astronomy to be Director of the Observatory, with a moderate salary and an Assistant.

At Oxford and Cambridge the observations made have been partly meridional and partly extra-meridional. At both these establishments the tendency in recent years has been towards a more exclusive prosecution of extra-meridional observations, as offering an appropriate and eminently fertile field for the advancement of astronomy. At Edinburgh the observations have been exclusively meridional, the Observatory not being furnished with an instrument adapted to the prosecution of observations out of the meridian.

The Observatories of Oxford, Cambridge, and Edinburgh, were originally supplied with only one Assistant, but as the sphere of operations was enlarged, there arose the necessity for additional aid. At present there are three Assistants at the Oxford Observatory, two at the Cambridge Observatory, and two at the Edinburgh Observatory.

The expediency of establishing an Astronomical Observatory in connexion with the University of Glasgow, formed a subject of discussion in the Uni-

{145}------------------------------------------------

versity as early as the year 1754. In the year 1760 the Directorship of the Observatory was founded by the Crown, simultaneously with the Chair of Practical Astronomy, the same individual being eligible to both offices. In the Royal Commission for his appointment, the occupant of this two-fold office is styled 'Regius Professor of Practical Astronomy and Observer in the University of Glasgow.' The Observatory was erected at the expense of the University, and was originally called the "Macfarlane Observatory," from the circumstance of its having been furnished with instruments bequeathed to the University of Glasgow by a gentleman of the name of Macfarlane, who died in Jamaica, in the year 1755. This designation was subsequently abandoned on the occasion of the Observatory being transferred to another locality. The first Observer was Dr. Alexander Wilson, who has earned for himself a name in the history of astronomy by his observations and speculations on the solar spots. The second Observer was Dr. Patrick Wilson, who bequeathed to the University the sum of one thousand pounds, the annual interest of which was to be expended in the purchase of instruments, models, and books for the Observatory.

In 1845 the University purchased from an Astronomical Institution which existed only for a short time, the present observatory buildings, furnishing the establishment at the same time with a Meridian Circle by one of the first instrument-makers of Germany. In 1860 a course of astronomical observations was

{146}------------------------------------------------

commenced with this instrument. The objects selected for observation have been the smaller classes of stars, and such of the more recently discovered planets as could be reached by the optical power of the instrument.

One of the most important departments of observing astronomy in the present day, consists of observations of the group of planets revolving between Mars and Jupiter. These bodies are so minute, and the theory of their movements is still in so imperfect a state, that it is only by means of assiduous observations of their positions, when they are favourably situated for that purpose, and fresh determinations of their orbits, founded upon the new observations, that astronomers are enabled to find them out in the heavens. At the Glasgow Observatory it has been the practice, since the establishment of astronomical operations, to observe such of the minor planets as could be seen sufficiently well in the telescope of the Meridian Circle. Some of these observations have appeared in the *Astronomische Nachrichten*, a journal which is usually employed by astronomers of all countries for the publication of such results. In the case of four of the planets, the observations thus published have been combined with corresponding observations made at other observatories, and the aggregate results for each planet have formed the groundwork for a fresh determination of its orbit. In the Berlin *Astronomisches Jahrbuch*, for 1864, published by the authority of the Prussian Government, under the super-

{147}------------------------------------------------

intendence of the distinguished Astronomer, Professor Encke, a list is given of the Observatories which furnished the materials for the calculation of the orbits of the various minor planets which will come to opposition in the course of the present year. It will be seen from this statement that the Glasgow Observatory occupies an honourable place with other similar establishments, both in Europe and America, which have co-operated in the promotion of the same object. Your memorialist has the honour of forwarding herewith a copy of the volume of the *Berlin Astronomisches Jahrbuch* referred to, from which it will be ascertained that the determination of the orbits of the minor planets Flora, Amphitrite, Euterpe, and Eunomia, and the computation of the places of those bodies for the present year, rest exclusively on observations of their positions made at the Observatories of Glasgow, Göttingen and Pulkowa.—(pp. 320, 341, 366, 370.)

The field of operations at the Glasgow Observatory has hitherto been somewhat circumscribed, from the establishment not being furnished with an equatorially mounted refracting telescope, adapted for making extra-meridional observations of the heavenly bodies. This defect will speedily be remedied, thanks to a few gentlemen, chiefly residing in Glasgow, by whose liberal co-operation the University has been enabled to purchase one of the largest and most perfect refractors in the British Isles. With the accession of this instrument the equipment of the Observatory may be

{148}------------------------------------------------

said to be equal to that of any other academical observatory in Europe.

The Observatory supplies the Royal Exchange of Glasgow with correct time. Its usefulness in this respect is about to receive an important extension, the Town Council having recently decided upon laying down a wire which shall connect the Observatory with several of the City clocks, with a view to the control of the latter by an electric current proceeding from the Normal Clock of the Observatory. The method of control which it is proposed to adopt, has been already employed with complete success in London, Edinburgh and Liverpool, and it can hardly be doubted that, when once introduced into Glasgow, it will be speedily appropriated to the supplying of several public establishments with correct time, and to the dropping of the Time Ball at the Broomielaw, for the use of the Shipping in the Clyde.

A regular system of Meteorological observations has been carried on for many years at the Observatory.

Your Memorialist has the honour to forward herewith a Report of the Operations at the Observatory during the year 1860-1.

During the present session your memorialist has delivered a course of lectures on Astronomy at the College. The number of students who have attended these lectures is small, but they appear to have been earnest and diligent students. Concurrently with the lectures at the College, expositions of Instrumental Astronomy have been given at the Observatory.

{149}------------------------------------------------

Your memorialist would respectfully urge upon your consideration the expediency of appointing an Assistant at the Glasgow Observatory, and appropriating a small annual sum to defray the current expenses of the establishment upon the following grounds.

1. The office of Observer in the University of Glasgow was founded by the Crown. It may therefore be presumed to possess strong claims on the attention of Her Majesty's Commissioners.

2. A regular course of astronomical observations has been instituted at the Observatory. The value of these observations has received a European recognition from the fact of their having been employed by the German astronomers in the calculations for determining the orbits of the minor planets.

3. The sphere of usefulness of the Observatory will soon receive a large extension in consequence of the accession to the establishment of an equatorially mounted refracting telescope of great optical power, and the application of an improved method of transmitting correct time to various important establishments connected with the City and Port of Glasgow.

4. The University of Glasgow has liberally contributed to the efficiency of the Observatory. It has expended a large sum of money in the purchase of the present Observatory, and in furnishing it with instruments of great value. The salary of the Professor who has the charge of the Observatory is also mainly derived from the funds of the University. On the ground, therefore, of the great sacrifices which it has made to

{150}------------------------------------------------

promote the efficiency of the Observatory, the University may justly expect that Her Majesty's Commissioners will not refuse their aid in matters wherein its own disposable resources fall short of the requirements of the establishment.

5. In organization and equipment, the Observatory is mainly identical with the other academic observatories which have been established in the British Isles and on the Continent. Only a small annual sum of money in addition is wanted, to place it on an efficient footing.

6. The daily prosecution of meteorological observations, and the necessity of constantly watching the state of the heavens with a view to make observations, for obtaining correct time, would alone render an Assistant at the Observatory indispensable. At present your memorialist is obliged to provide for an assistant out of his own salary, which amounts to only two hundred and seventy pounds a year. From the circumstance of the Chair not being included in the ordinary Curriculum of Study, the income derivable from class fees must always be trifling.

7. The Edinburgh Observatory having been supplied with two Assistants by Her Majesty's Government, the ancient University of Glasgow may reasonably expect that an Observatory, for which it has made such large sacrifices, is also entitled to receive from the same quarter the small additional assistance which is requisite for placing the establishment on an efficient footing. It is true that the Director of the Edinburgh

{151}------------------------------------------------

Observatory is styled Her Majesty's Astronomer for Scotland, but this is a mere barren title, for in point of fact the operations at the Edinburgh Observatory are identical in their general character with those pursued at Cambridge or any other Academic Observatory, the only difference consisting in this, that the Edinburgh Observatory being unprovided with an equatorial, the observations made at that establishment, instead of being partly meridional and partly extra-meridional, are necessarily all of the former class.

8. The Glasgow Observatory being now furnished with a powerful equatorially mounted Refracting Telescope, admirably adapted for making extra-meridional observations of the heavenly bodies, in addition to an excellent Meridian Circle, the occasion seems eminently appropriate for giving some encouragement to the prosecution of Observing Astronomy in Scotland. With the exception of one equatorial besides, in the possession of a private gentleman, there does not exist, nor ever has existed any other instrument of the same class, worthy of the name, in Scotland, which could be employed in making accurate extra-meridional observations. It is to be borne in mind however, that observations of this description offer a vast field for the advancement of astronomy, and one which is eminently adapted to the resources of an Academical Observatory.
