# 101 AIZOACEAE <sup>1</sup>

Dennis I Morris <sup>2</sup>, Marco F Duretto <sup>3</sup>

Annual or perennial, monoecious herbs or, less often, shrubs. Leaves opposite or alternate in false whorls, exstipulate or more rarely stipulate, sometimes reduced to scales, often succulent or subsucculent, flat, terete or triquetrous, glabrous, papillate or rarely pubescent or lepidote. Inflorescence terminal or axillary, flowers solitary or in loose cymes, sessile or pedicellate, bracteate or ebracteate. Flowers usually actinomorphic, bisexual or rarely unisexual and the plant monoecious. Sepals (3–)5–8, herbaceous, persistent, often succulent, equal or unequal. Petals 0. Staminodes 0-many, often petaloid and showy in 1–6 whorls (by many authors referred to as petals). Fertile stamens (1–)4–many, free or connate at the base, anthers small. Gynoecium of 2–5(-many) carpels united in a compound ovary, superior, half-inferior or inferior, with as many loculi as carpels; styles as many as loculi; ovules 1-many per locule; placentation usually axile but sometimes parietal or basal. Fruit usually a capsule, dehiscing loculicidally, septicidally, or circumsessile or indehiscent or a berry. Seed with a curved embryo enveloping a mealy endosperm.

A family of about 120 genera and 2000–2500 species. Some 100 of the genera earlier considered as constituting the large genus *Mesembryanthemum* (see Klak *et al.* 2007). The primary centres of diversity are South Africa and the Mediterranean region. In Australia there are 19 genera and about 80 species, of which 54 species in 8 genera are native. In Tasmania there are 6 genera and 10 species, of which 3 genera and 6 species are introduced. Aizoaceae are placed in the Caryophyllales near Phytolaccaceae (Americas, Africa, Asia), Sarcobataceae (SW North America) and Nyctaginaceae (tropical & warm temperate regions) (see Stevens 2007 & references cited therein).

Synonymy: Galeniaceae, Mesembryanthaceae, Tetragoniaceae.

Key references: Prescott & Venning (1984); Walsh (1996).

- 7. Stems erect or ascending; leaves 0.9–1.4 cm long; flowers yellow **[3 Lampranthus](#block-5-6)**
- 7: Stems prostrate; leaves 2–5 cm long; flowers purple **[4 Disphyma](#block-5-8)**

\**Zaleya galericulata* (Melville) H.Eichler (Hogweed) was said to be naturalized in Tasmania by Walsh (1996). The species is native to all other states of Australia (see also Prescott & Venning 1984). There are no herbarium specimens from Tasmania lodged at the Tasmania Herbarium and the genus is not treated further here. See Richardson *et al.* (2006) for a description and photograph.

++ *Drosanthemum candens* (Haw.) Schwantes (Rodondo Creeper; from South Africa) is planted in seaside areas. It has become established in Western Australia, and is an occasional garden escape in South Australia and Victoria (see Prescott & Venning 1984; Walsh 1996). A single collection of this species was made in 2000 from the Sorrell Causeway. The species is not treated further here. See Richardson *et al.* (2006) for a description and photograph.

## 1 \* MESEMBRYANTHEMUM

*Mesembryanthemum* L., *Sp. Pl.* 1: 480 (1753).

Synonymy: *Psilocaule* N.E.Br., *Gard. Chron.* 78: 433 (1925). *Gasoul* Adans., *Fam. Pl.* (Adanson) 2: 243 (1763). *Cryophytum* N.E.Br., *Gard. Chron.* 78: 412 (1925). *Aptenia* N.E.Br., *Gard. Chron.* 78: 412 (1925). *Litocarpus* L.Bolus, *Fl. Pl. South Africa* 7: 261 (1927).

Annual or biennial herbs, succulent, sometimes prostrate or rambling; stems and branches angled or terete, conspicuously papillate, the papillae vesicular, glistening. Leaves fleshy, flat or semiterete, opposite, sometimes becoming alternate on flowering branches, sessile or petiolate. Flowers solitary, axillary, sessile or shortly pedicellate. Calyx tubular, 4–5-lobed, 3 smaller lobes with membranous margins or alternating larger and smaller. Petaloid staminodes numerous, white, mauve to reddish; fertile stamens numerous. Ovary inferior or half-inferior, 5-locular, placentation axile; styles 5, free. Fruit a hygroscopic capsule, the valves winged. Seeds numerous, compressed, minutely tuberculate.

A genus of about 100 species distributed along the coasts of western North America, southern Europe, Africa and the Middle East. 3 species naturalized in Australia. Several species are grown as ornamentals. Klak *et al.* (2007) presented a cladistic analysis of the Mesembryanthemoideae and showed that *Mesembryanthemum* was not a natural group if the other members of the tribe were not included in it and so reduced 11 genera, including *Aptenia* and *Psilocaule* (both represented in Australia by naturalized species), to synonymy.

- 1. Petaloid staminodes white, sometimes with pink tips; sepals 5; leaves alternate on flowering branches **1 *M. crystallinum***

A fleshy perennial herb with stout prostrate stems to 1 m long rooting at some of the nodes. Leaves fleshy, linear and terete or trigonous, opposite but apparently clustered because of the development of the leaves on very short axillary branches, 2–5 cm long, apex usually blunt, base stem-clasping, glabrous, often reddish in colour at least at the tip. Flowers showy, 3–4 cm diam., solitary and terminal; pedicel arising between the 2 leaves of a very short axillary flowering branch, usually longer than the leaves and thicker towards the top, below the flower; receptacle-tube turbinate, c. 5 mm long. Sepals fleshy, unequal, the 2 longer ones about as long as the tube, the 3 shorter ones with membranous wings. Petaloid staminodes magenta or the proximal third almost white, numerous, narrow-linear, 15–20 mm long; stamens numerous, in several rows, white, filaments shorter than the petaloid staminodes and with a tuft of slender hairs at the base; anthers versatile. Stigmas 5, ending in filiform appendages. Fruit a capsule; valves prominent, rounded, at first red and succulent, later dry and hard, when turned back, the valves each with 2 horny longitudinal ridges arising on either side of a septum and with membranous marginal wings. Flowering Oct.-Jan. (Apr.); fruiting Dec.-Aug.
