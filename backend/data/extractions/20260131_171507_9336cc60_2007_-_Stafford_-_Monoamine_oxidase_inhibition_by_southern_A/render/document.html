    Abstract
   </h2>
   <p>
    Traditional health care is utilized by a large majority of the population in southern Africa. This is particularly true of treatment for mental health problems. A large part of the treatment regimes used by traditional healers involve numerous herbal preparations. Twenty plants used traditionally were screened for MAO inhibition and specific MAO-B inhibition activity. MAO-B inhibitors are currently employed in the treatment of neurodegenerative related illnesses such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. A photometric peroxidase linked assay was used to determine the inhibition of the oxidative deamination of tyramine by MAO isolated from rat liver.

    1. Introduction
   </h2>
   <p>
    Traditional health care is utilized by a large majority of the population, as many as 80%, in southern Africa. It is estimated that 27 million South Africans depend on traditional herbal medicines from as many as 1020 plant species
    <a href="#block-5-0">(Dauskardt, 1990; Williams,</a>
    <a href="#block-5-0">1996; Fennell et al., 2004</a>
    ). This is particularly true of treatment for mental health problems. This is partly due to a severe lack of facilities for treatment of mental disease in the modern southern African health care system, but also because these diseases in their cultural context are believed to be better handled by a traditional healer
    <a href="#block-6-0">(Swift and Asuni, 1975</a>
    ). A large part of the treatment regimes used by traditional healers comprise numerous herbal preparations which are administered to the patients. African traditional healers recognize and treat numerous mental illnesses and disorders of the central nervous system, including anxiety, fits, convulsions, epilepsy, hysteria, nightmares and mental distur-

    <a href="#block-5-0">Gerstner, 1941; Watt</a>
    <a href="#block-5-0">and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962; Gelfand et al., 1985; Hutchings and</a>

    <a href="#block-5-0">Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000; Sobiecki, 2002</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Complementing southern Africa's large cultural diversity is an exceptionally rich plant diversity with an estimated 30,000 species of flowering plants, that is almost one tenth of the world's higher plants. There are ten endemic families, while 80% of the species and 29% of the genera are endemic (
    <a href="#block-5-0">Goldblatt, 1978</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme present in the outer-mitochondrial membrane of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Two isoforms of MAO are recognized, commonly referred to as MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO enzymes are responsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenous and xenobiotic amines. They have a different substrate preference, inhibitor specificity, and tissue distribution (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Yamada and Yasuhara, 2004</a>
    ). MAO-A preferentially deaminates serotonin, noradrenaline, and adrenaline. In the human brain about 75% of MAO is of the B subtype (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Saura Marti et al., 1990</a>
    ). MAO-B deaminates dopamine,

    cause an increase in the amount of these amines stored and released from the nerve terminals, thus increasing the monoaminergic activity. Inhibition of MAO-A predominantly affects neurotransmitters considered to be important in depression and anxiety disorders. MAO-B inhibitors would increase the basal dopamine levels in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic input pathway. Selegiline is the only selective and irreversible MAO-B inhibitor with marketing approval in many countries (
    <a href="#block-5-0">Bodkin and</a>
    <a href="#block-5-0">Amsterdam, 2002; Yamada and Yasuhara, 2004</a>
    ). More recently, MAO-B inhibitors have been included in the treatment of anxiety disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Yamada and Yasuhara,</a>
    <a href="#block-6-0">2004</a>
    ). MAO-B inhibition also has neuroprotective effects, since the oxidation step catalyzed by MAO-B yields reactive hydrogen peroxide as a by-product of amine turnover, the generated hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species may cause deterioration in neuronal function or eventually lead to neuronal death (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Yamada and Yasuhara, 2004</a>
    ).

    The pharmaceutical potential of MAO inhibitors, in particular MAO-B inhibitors, has led to the search for novel active compounds. Apart from
    <i>
     Hypericum perforatum
    </i>
    which contains hypericin reported to show MAO inhibitory activity
    <a href="#block-5-0">(Butterweck</a>
    <a href="#block-5-0">et al., 2002</a>
    ), several herbal remedies have been investigated. Recent discoveries of specific MAO-A inhibitory activity of traditionally used herbal remedies include
    <i>
     Acorus gramineus
    </i>
    <a href="#block-6-0">(Tao</a>

    <a href="#block-6-0">(Huong</a>
    <a href="#block-6-0">et al., 2002</a>

    To date little or no work has been conducted on the MAO inhibitory activity of southern African medicinal plants. Over 300 species are reported to be used traditionally in southern Africa for psychoactive purposes (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Sobiecki, 2002</a>
    ). The aim of this investigation was to screen southern African plants that are used traditionally to treat mental illness for MAO and selective MAO-B inhibitory activity. These plants and their traditional uses in southern Africa are shown in
    <a href="#block-1-0">Table 1</a>

   <h3>
    2.1. Plant materials
   </h3>
   <p>
    Plant species traditionally used as sedatives or to treat various CNS-related ailments were selected based on
   </p>
   <p>
    information in a database on plants used to treat mental diseases, constructed at the Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, University of KwaZulu-Natal. The information in the database largely originates from published literature.
    <a href="#block-3-0">Table 2</a>
    contains information pertaining to the traditional use. Plants were collected in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Voucher specimens are deposited in the University of KwaZulu-Natal Herbarium (
    <a href="#block-1-0">Table 1</a>
    ). Plant material was dried at 50 °C for a maximum of 2 days. Ethical clearance for these studies has been granted by the University of KwaZulu-Natal Research Committee, Animal Ethics Subcommittee (Ref: AE/Van Staden/06).
   </p>
   <h3>
    2.2. Preparations of extracts
   </h3>
   <p>
    Two grams of material was extracted three times with 20 ml solvent (water, 70% ethanol, ethyl acetate and petroleum ether) for 60 min on an ultrasound bath. The extracts were then filtered under vacuum through Whatman No 1 filter paper. The filtered extracts were taken to dryness under reduced pressure at 40 °C. The residues were re-dissolved in DMSO respectively at 36 mg/ml when required, to be diluted further in the assay with potassium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.6) to seven final concentrations of 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001 mg/ml respectively.
   </p>
   <h3>
    2.3. Preparation of rat liver homogenate
   </h3>
   <p>
    MAO was partially purified by isolation of mitochondria from rat liver homogenates according to
    <a href="#block-5-0">Holt et al. (1997)</a>
    . Briefly, male Wistar rats (280–300 g) were euthanised by carbon monoxide (Biomedical Resource Centre, University of KwaZulu-Natal) and livers dissected out, washed in ice-cold potassium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.6), and stored at –70 °C until required. Liver tissue (5 g) was homogenized 1:40 (w/v) in 0.3 M sucrose. Following centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 10 min the supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min to obtain a crude mitochondrial pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of 0.3 M sucrose and was layered onto 40 ml of 1.2 M sucrose. A mitochondrial pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 53,000 ×g for 2 h. Following a single wash in potassium phosphate buffer, mitochondria were suspended in 40 ml buffer. Total protein concentration was measured by the method of
    <a href="#block-5-0">Bradford</a>
    <a href="#block-5-0">(1976)</a>
    and adjusted with phosphate buffer (0.2 M; pH 7.6) to

    (
    <a href="#block-4-0">Fig. 1</a>
    ). Plant extracts (water, 70% ethanol, ethyl acetate and petroleum ether) were re-dissolved to 36 mg/ml with DMSO. Plant extracts were serially diluted with potassium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.6) and 40 µl of each dilution was placed in 96-well microplates (PS Microplate, non-sterile, Greiner Bio-One) to give final concentrations from 6 to 0.00006 mg/ml (seven dilutions). Distilled water was used as a negative control. Each test well contained 120 µl amino substrated (2.5 mM tyramine (Sigma-Aldrich) in potassium phosphate buffer), 40 µl chromogenic solution (1 mM vanillic acid (Sigma), 0.5 mM 4-aminoantipyrine (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 U/ml peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) in potassium phosphate buffer), 40 µl enzyme (rat liver homogenate) and 40 µl of sample. Background wells contained potassium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.6) in place of enzyme (rat liver homogenate). To test for specific MAO-B activity the rat liver homogenate was pre-incubated (37 °C; 30 min) with 50 µM clorgyline (selective MAO-A-I, Sigma-Aldrich) to total block MAO-A activity. Reactions were followed at 490 nm using a microplate reader. Absorbancy readings were taken every 5 min over a period of 40 min. Plates were incubated

    concentrations and standard error were calculated using Graftit 5 (© Erithacus Software Limited). The standard error (SE) calculated is related to closeness of fit of the activity at each concentration of extract to the sigmoidal

    Since ancient times,
    <i>
     R. graveolens
    </i>
    (garden rue) has been an important plant in the European pharmacopoeia (
    <a href="#block-6-0">San Miguel,</a>
    <a href="#block-6-0">2003</a>
    ). Its medicinal value is due to the numerous secondary metabolites it contains like furocoumarins, furoquinolines and acridone alkaloids. Recently, the methanol, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and water–methanol extracts of
    <i>
     R. graveolens
    </i>
    were found to possess antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Ivanova et al., 2005</a>
    ). Amongst furocoumarins, bergapten has been used for decades for the treatment of various skin diseases such as vitiligo and psoriasis (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Song and Tapley, 1979</a>
    ). Further studies are required to determine the chemical(s) involved in the MAO inhibition.
    <i>
     M. aquatica
    </i>
    is known to contain flavones and flavanone derivatives (
    <a href="#block-5-0">Burzanska-Hermann et al., 1977</a>
    ) which may be responsible for the observed activity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tyramine is a substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B. An important characteristic of traditional MAOIs, such as tranylcypromine and phenelzine, is their lack of selectivity for MAO isoenzymes. By inhibiting both these compounds the metabolism of ingested exogenous tyramine often results in the accumulation of tyramine. This has the potential to precipitate a dangerous hypertensive crisis, known as the ‘cheese effect’ (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Yamada and Yasuhara, 2004</a>
    ). There are very few known specific MAO-B inhibitors and it is hoped that such novel compounds can be isolated and identified from the active plants highlighted in this investigation.

     Figure 2: Four graphs showing the IC50 determinations of R. graveolens MAO activity and MAO-B activity for ethyl acetate and petroleum ether extracts. The top row shows MAO activity for ethyl acetate extracts, and the bottom row shows MAO-B activity for petroleum ether extracts. Each graph plots % activity (0-100) against extract concentration (10^-4 to 10^-1 mg/ml) on a log scale. The curves show a decrease in activity as concentration increases, with data points marked by open circles.

    The success of traditional medicines is often attributed to the 'placebo effect' (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Weiss, 1988</a>
    ), rather than through active principles producing predictable physiological responses, some of these findings support the latter and may lead to the discovery of novel MAO inhibitors.
