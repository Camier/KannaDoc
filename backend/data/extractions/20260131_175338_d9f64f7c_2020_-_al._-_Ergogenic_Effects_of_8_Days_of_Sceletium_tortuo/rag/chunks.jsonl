A single core session is composed of 20 individual trials calculating spatial awareness by determining a threshold speed for the effective perception and processing of visual information of the individual being tested. Each trial was performed in an isolated room, free of distractions. During each assessment, a 3-dimensional transparent cube containing 8 identical yellow balls, measuring 14 cm in diameter, was presented on a screen. Four of these balls were randomly illuminated for 2 seconds before returning to the baseline yellow color. Each subject was instructed to track these 4 balls for the duration of each of the 20 trials. During each trial, all 8 yellow balls moved simultaneously and individually throughout all regions of the cube for 8 seconds. The random, continuous, movement patterns of each ball were only affected by collisions (impact and bounce) with the wall of the cube and the other balls. At the conclusion of 8 seconds, the balls were frozen in place and assigned a value (1–8). The subject was instructed to identify, by number, the 4 balls that were originally illuminated at the start of the trial. The speed at which the balls moved on the next trial was dependent on the correct identification of the illuminated balls and was adjusted between trials in a staircase (1 up 1 down) fashion. At the end of the 20 trials, visual tracking speed was determined to be the fastest speed (in centimeters per second) at which the subject could correctly identify all balls with 100% accuracy. Subjects completed 1 trial on the Neurotracker during both T1 and T2 testing.</p>", "page": 1, "polygon": [[819.0, 996.0], [1501.0, 996.0], [1501.0, 1873.0], [819.0, 1873.0]], "bbox": [819.0, 996.0, 1501.0, 1873.0], "section_hierarchy": {"1": "/page/0/SectionHeader/2", "2": "/page/1/SectionHeader/3", "3": "/page/1/SectionHeader/8"}, "images": {}, "chunk_id": 33}

The board contains 64 target buttons arranged into 5 concentric circles that can be illuminated to serve as a stimulus for the subject. For each task, subjects were instructed to take an athletic stance, consisting of flexed knees, low center of gravity, and upright posture. The D2 board was then raised or lowered to the height of the subject, such that the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen was approximately at eye level, and the outermost target buttons were within hands reach.</p>\n", "page": 2, "polygon": [[143.0, 587.0], [806.0, 587.0], [806.0, 939.0], [143.0, 939.0]], "bbox": [143.0, 587.0, 806.0, 939.0], "section_hierarchy": {"1": "/page/0/SectionHeader/2", "2": "/page/1/SectionHeader/3", "3": "/page/1/SectionHeader/8"}, "images": {}, "chunk_id": 42}
{"id": "/page/2/Text/5", "block_type": "Text", "html": "\n<p>Three separate tests were performed with the D2 device: The first assessment measured visual, motor, and physical reaction time with the dominant hand. The test was initiated when the subject placed their hand on the illuminated “home” button. At this point, a stimulus was presented in 1 of the 5 locations, parallel to the home button. Visual reaction time was determined as the amount of time it took to identify the stimulus and initiate a reaction by leaving the home button. Motor response time was measured as the amount of time it took to physically strike the stimulus following the initial visual reaction, and physical reaction time was determined by the total elapsed time from the introduction of the target stimulus to the physical completion of the task (returning to the home button after striking the stimulus). This was repeated 10 times. The average time for all 10 attempts was recorded. The second assessment (mode A) performed on the D2 device measured the subject’s ability to react to a stimulus as it changed positions on the board. An initial stimulus was presented on the D2 in a random location. The stimulus remained lit until the subjects struck it. The stimulus then appeared at another random location. The subjects was instructed to identify and strike as many stimuli as possible within 60 seconds. The total number of hits was recorded. The next assessment (mode B) on the D2 was similar to the second assessment, and subjects were required to react to a visual stimulus as it changed positions on the board. However, the stimulus remained illuminated for 1 second before changing to another random location on the board. However, during the assessment, the subject was required to verbally recite a 5-digit number that presented on the center screen of the D2 during each assessment. Each subject was required to correctly identify the 5-digit number and strike as many stimuli as possible within 60 seconds. The number of hits, average time per hit, and the number of missed stimuli were recorded (e.g., 5-digit numbers that were not correctly identified).</p>\n", "page": 2, "polygon": [[143.0, 937.0], [806.0, 937.0], [806.0, 1902.0], [143.0, 1902.0]], "bbox": [143.0, 937.0, 806.0, 1902.0], "section_hierarchy": {"1": "/page/0/SectionHeader/2", "2": "/page/1/SectionHeader/3", "3": "/page/1/SectionHeader/8"}, "images": {}, "chunk_id": 43}

Subjects were required to stand 3-m perpendicular to a series of 4 lights aligned in a semicircle 1 m apart such that the distance between the starting position and each light was equal. At the onset of the protocol, the subject stood in the middle of the 4 lights. In random fashion, one of the lights was illuminated, and the subject was required to sprint and react to the light by waving his or her hand 10 cm above the light and then return to the starting position backpedaling. In total, 5 lights were illuminated. The subject had 2 seconds to recognize and reach each light. A 1-second pause was provided between the dimming of one light and the illumination of the next light. The total time and the average reaction time per light was recorded. A second assessment with FITLIGHT was completed to assess reactive agility with decision making. During this test, the lights were placed in a Y-shaped format. Subjects stood 2 m in front of the first light. Upon a visual stimulus (first light was illuminated), the subject sprinted in a straight line to the second light (3 m from the starting position). The third and fourth lights were placed <math>45^\\circ</math> to the right and left of the second light (1.5 m away).
