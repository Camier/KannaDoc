    ABSTRACT
   </h2>
   <p>
    The majority of the population in South Africa use traditional health care to treat various mental conditions. In this review, we present ethnobotanical information on plants used by the traditional healers in South Africa to treat mental illnesses, specifically epilepsy, depression, age-related dementia and debilitating mental disorders. Details of the recent scientific studies conducted on some of these plants are reviewed.

   <h2>
    1. Introduction
   </h2>
   <p>
    Currently in South Africa a dual healthcare system exists: one based on traditional medicine and another based on Western medical practice. The use of traditional medicine in South Africa is widespread where it is estimated that as high as 80% of the
   </p>
   <p>
    black population consult traditional healers. The more available traditional healthcare system offers a cheap, individualized and culturally appropriate alternative to the costly allopathic system. The state healthcare system with 8000 doctors including 18 neurologists provides aid for 85% of the population (approximately 38 million people) whereas 15% of the population (approximately 7 million people) is covered by private healthcare system with 12,000 doctors including 55 neurologists (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Eastman, 2</a>
    005). The number of traditional healers, on the other hand, outnumbers the allopathic doctors by at least 10 to 1 (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Morris, 2</a>
    001).
   </p>
   <p>
    Traditional practice may include psychological, spiritual and cultural elements, as well as a medical element. This review deals with the medical element, namely the plants traditional healers use in their treatments. In this paper we will review plants used in South African traditional medicine in these categories of indications: epilepsy and convulsions, depression, age-related dementia and debilitating mental disorders.

    2. Plants used for mental health ailments
   </h2>
   <p>
    Traditional healers in South Africa make use of a plethora of plants. Nearly 150 plant species from 63 families are used for the indications epilepsy and convulsions (
    <a href="#block-1-0">Table 1),</a>
    possibly reflecting the severity of this problem in the population. The families most often represented are Fabaceae (15 species), Asteraceae (13 species) and Lamiaceae (9 species) (
    <a href="#block-1-0">Table 1)</a>
    . Over 40 plant species are used for ailments that could be described as depression (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Table 2).</a>
    These plants come from 26 different families. The number of plants used for dementia and age-related mental problems are lower with only 15 species from 7 families recorded (
    <a href="#block-16-0">Table 3),</a>
    which could be due to a previous demographic situation, where traditional healers less frequently had very old patients. Amaryllidaceae is the best-represented family with six species (
    <a href="#block-16-0">Table 3).</a>
    Mental health problems constitute a serious problem in southern Africa. Not surprisingly, a large number, well over 300 species, of plants are used by traditional healers in their treatment of these ailments (

    3. Plants used for convulsions and epilepsy
   </h2>
   <h3>
    3.1. Epilepsy in southern Africa
   </h3>
   <p>
    The prevalence of epilepsy in developing countries is generally higher than in developed countries (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Sander a</a>
    nd
    <a href="#block-23-0">Shorvon, 1</a>
    996). A recent study reports an increased risk of dying and a greater proportion of deaths that are epilepsy-related in Africa – as high
    <a href="#block-24-0">as a</a>
    six-fold increase in mortality in people with epilepsy. This is higher than the two- to three-fold increase reported in developed countries (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Christianson e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-22-0">al., 2</a>
    000;
    <a href="#block-22-0">Diop
     <a href="#block-22-0">

     t
     <a href="#block-22-0">a</a>
     l.,
     <a href="#block-22-0">2</a>
     005).
    </a>
    The reasons for this gap between the developed and the developing countries are not entirely clear but suggestions have been made that it might be due to social deprivation (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Sander, 2</a>
    003). Interestingly, recent data suggest that people from socio-economically deprived backgrounds in developed countries are more likely to develop epilepsy (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Heaney
     <a href="#block-22-0">
      e</a>
     t
     <a href="#block-22-0">a</a>
     l.,
     <a href="#block-22-0">2</a>
     002).
    </a>
    A study from 2000 on the prevalence of epilepsy in a large rural community situated in the Northern Province in South Africa showed a lifetime prevalence in children as high as 73/1000 (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Christianson
     <a href="#block-22-0">
      e</a>
     t
     <a href="#block-22-0">a</a>
     l.,
     <a href="#block-22-0">2</a>
     000).
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    Some infectious diseases might be a part of the explanation. Neurocysticercosis caused by
    <i>
     Taenia solium
    </i>
    (pork tapeworm) infections may trigger epileptic outburst (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Garcia e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-22-0">al., 2</a>
    003;
    <a href="#block-22-0">DeGiorgio</a>
    <a href="#block-22-0">et a</a>
    l.,
    <a href="#block-22-0">2005).</a>
    A study on 578 epileptic patients in Pretoria showed neurocysticercosis in 28% of the patients (
    <a href="#block-24-0">van A</a>
    s
    <a href="#block-24-0">and Jo</a>
    ubert,
    <a href="#block-24-0">1991).</a>
    HIV infection of the CNS or opportunistic infections caused by HIV might also trigger epileptic seizures (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Garg, 1</a>
    999;
    <a href="#block-22-0">Visudtibhan
     <a href="#block-22-0">
      e</a>
     t
     <a href="#block-22-0">a</a>
     l.,
    </a>
    <a href="#block-22-0">1999).</a>
    With an estimated 5.5 million HIV positives in South Africa at the end of 2006 with a prevalence of 39% in the KwaZulu-Natal province this is an alarming scenario (
    <a href="#block-24-0">UNAIDS, 2</a>
    006,
    <a href="#block-24-0">2007).</a>
   </p>
   <p>
    Epilepsy is often viewed with a certain degree of fear and risk of contagious effect due to the cultural attitudes
    <a href="#block-22-0">and b</a>
    eliefs in South Africa. Studies conducted in townships showed that the parents of epileptic children believe that the disorder is caused by various parameters including bewitchment, fear or evil spirits (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Eastman,</a>
    <a href="#block-22-0">2005).</a>
    It is viewed as a shameful disorder and has severe social implications in African communities as it carries a stigma. Sufferers are often shunned and discriminated against with respect to education, employment and marriage (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Andermann, 1</a>
    995;
    <a href="#block-22-0">Baskind</a>
    and
    <a href="#block-22-0">Birbeck, 2</a>
    005).
   </p>
   <p>
    This cultural influence is also prominent in the treatment of the disorder where many people seek treatment by traditional healers and traditional medicine. A survey in 2000 showed, that 42.5% of epileptic children received traditional medicine alone or together
   </p>
   <p>
    with Western medicine whereas 34.6% received no treatment at all (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Christianson e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-22-0">al., 2</a>
    000).
   </p>
   <h3>
    3.2. Studies on plants used to treat convulsions and epilepsy in South Africa
   </h3>
   <p>
    Numerous plants used in the traditional South African medicine have been screened for compounds with affinity to the flumazenil-sensitive benzodiazepine modulatory sites on the GABA (
    <math>
     \gamma
    </math>
    -aminobutyric acid) subtype A receptor. Initially, the aqueous and ethanol extracts of 43 South African medicinal plants traditionally used to treat epilepsy and convulsions were tested in the GABA

     A
    </sub>
    -benzodiazepine receptor-binding assay (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Risa e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-23-0">al., 2</a>
    004a).
   </p>
   <p>
    In a second study, 46
    <a href="#block-24-0">et</a>
    hanol extracts from 35 species both indigenous and exotic that ar
    <a href="#block-24-0">e t</a>
    raditionally used predominantly as sedatives or to treat various CNS-related ailments were tested in the GABA
    <sub>
     A
    </sub>
    -benzodiazepine receptor-binding assay (
    <a href="#block-24-0">Stafford e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-24-0">al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-24-0">2005).</a>
    These investigations led to the screening, isolation and identification of the flavonoids apigenin, amentoflavone and agathisflavone as the active compounds from
    <i>
     Searsia
    </i>
    F.A. Barkley (basinym:
    <i>
     Rhus
    </i>
    ) species (Anacardiaceae) (
    <a href="#block-24-0">Svenningsen</a>
    <a href="#block-23-0">et
     <a href="#block-24-0">
      a</a>
     l.,
    </a>
    <a href="#block-24-0">2006)</a>
    and viridiflorol and (S)-naringenin from
    <i>
     Mentha aquatica
    </i>
    L. (Lamiaceae) (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Jäger e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-23-0">al., 2</a>
    007).
   </p>
   <p>
    The binding of apigenin and amentoflavone to the flumazenil site has previously been reported (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Nielsen e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-23-0">al., 1</a>
    988;
    <a href="#block-23-0">Viola</a>
    <a href="#block-23-0">et a</a>
    l.,
    <a href="#block-23-0">1995)</a>
    but apigenin showed no anticonvulsant properties
    <i>
     in vivo
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-24-0">Viola
     <a href="#block-23-0">
      e</a>
     t
     <a href="#block-24-0">a</a>
     l.,
     <a href="#block-24-0">1</a>
     995;
     <a href="#block-24-0">A</a>
     vallone
     <a href="#block-24-0">e</a>
     t
     <a href="#block-24-0">a</a>
     l.,
     <a href="#block-24-0">2</a>
     000).
    </a>
    Another group reported amentoflavone to be a relatively weak negative allosteric modulator of GABA action acting independently the flumazenil binding site (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Hanrahan
     <a href="#block-24-0">
      e</a>
     t
     <a href="#block-22-0">a</a>
     l.,
     <a href="#block-22-0">2</a>
     003).
    </a>
    Thus, the use of these plants as anticonvulsive agents suggests involvement of a different neurotransmitter system. Further functional characterization of the
    <i>
     Searsia
    </i>
    extracts showed inhibitory effects on spontaneous epileptiform discharges in mouse cortical slices (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Pedersen
     <a href="#block-22-0">
      e</a>
     t
     <a href="#block-23-0">a</a>
     l.,
    </a>
    <a href="#block-23-0">2008).</a>
    Interestingly, the effect was not caused by the previous isolated flavonoids. The extracts contained
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    -methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists, which might explain the effect of the plants reported by the traditional healers. However, these findings need be confirmed by
    <i>
     in vivo
    </i>
    anticonvulsive studies before any conclusions can be made.
   </p>
   <p>
    A number of southern African plants have shown
    <i>
     in vivo
    </i>
    anticonvulsant activity against seizures produced in mice by pentylen
    <a href="#block-23-0">et</a>
    etrazole (PTZ), picrotoxin (PIC), bicuculline (BIC) and NMDA. However, most of the studies have been conducted on plant extracts and the active constituents are yet to be identified. Recently,
    <a href="#block-23-0">Ojewole (</a>
    2008c) reported on the anticonvulsant effect of
    <i>

    <i>

   <h3>
    3.3. Conclusions
   </h3>
   <p>
    This review illustrates the difficulties of studying medicinal plants in assays for convulsions and epilepsy. The variety of effects, the lack of selectivity, the need for functional assays and the mismatch between
    <i>
     in vitro
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     in vivo
    </i>
    findings make it a challenging task to examine these plants for potential new anti-epileptic drugs. So far, very few compounds have been isolated and characterized. Most of the studies are conducted on extracts and the mechanism of action might involve several different neurotransmitter systems. When used by the traditional healers, the medicinal plants are often combined thus increasing the potential number of neuroactive compounds in the pool of ingredients making the identification of active components very difficult.

    4. Plants used for depression
   </h2>
   <h3>
    4.1. Depression in South Africa
   </h3>
   <p>
    Depressive disorders, including major depression and dysthymia, are significant and disabling illnesses. It is estimated that one in five individuals is affected by a mood disorder in his or her lifetime. The World Health Organization estimates that major depression is the fourth most important cause worldwide of loss in disability-adjusted life years, and will be the second most important cause by 2020 (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Murray and Lopez, 1996</a>
    ). Depression affects an estimated 121 million people worldwide.
   </p>
   <p>
    In
    <a href="#block-24-0">South A</a>
    frica in 1990, the overall suicide rate was 17.2 per 100,000, which is slightly higher than that in the
    <a href="#block-24-0">WHO r</a>
    eport
    <a href="#block-24-0">(2001).</a>
    Initial estimates from the
    <a href="#block-24-0">South African National Burden of Disease Study (2000)</a>
    indicated suicide as the 11th out of 20
   </p>
   <p>
    leading causes of mortality (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Bradshaw et al., 2003</a>
    ). South Africa has a history of traumatized citizens and is a society in transition. Suicidal behavior among the black population in South Africa has appeared to be on the increase (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Lourens and Naseema, 1998</a>
    ). South African, black youth do not only increasingly consider suicide as an option when they cannot cope, but act on it in certain cases as well – especially when they are under severe depression (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Meel, 2003</a>
    ). Depressive symptoms (64%) are highly prevalent immediately before suicide (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Heila et al., 1997</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    South Africa is in a HIV/AIDS epidemic of shattering dimensions (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Dorrington et al., 2001</a>
    ). At the turn of the Millennium about 200,000 had died of AIDS-related illnesses and about five million were estimated to be infected (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Harber, 2002</a>
    ). Depression in HIV-positive individuals is significantly higher, although depressive symptoms may not be strong enough to warrant a psychiatric diagnosis (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Fukunishi et al., 1997</a>
    ). Depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation are common among HIV-positive patients, occurring at comparable or greater rates than those found in a variety of other medically ill populations (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Judd and Mijch, 1996</a>
    ). In South Africa, as is the case in most Third World countries, there is a serious limitation for this care as treatment for severe mental disorders is not available in most primary health care settings.
   </p>
   <p>
    The ailment of depression is not recognized in traditional practice. However, a number of other states and conditions with symptoms similar to depression are known, for example the condition 'being put down' by the ancestors. Persons afflicted with curses and evil spirits have symptoms that often resemble a depressed state accompanied by lethargy. The incongruence between indigenous and western disease nomenclature makes it more difficult to evaluate the use of plants in a western scientific paradigm.
   </p>

    4.2. Studies on plants used to treat depression in South Africa

    ,
    <i>
     Boophone disticha
    </i>
    and
    <i>

    showed an effect in the functional assays. Ethanolic extracts from
    <i>
     Agapanthus campanulatus

    ,
    <i>
     Boophone disticha

    </i>
    antidepressant-like effects in three animal models for depression (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Pedersen et al., 2008</a>
    ). The assays employed were forced swim test in both mice and rats and th
    <a href="#block-23-0">e ta</a>
    il suspension test in mice. All four extracts exhibited antidepressant-like effects in the animal models in various degrees.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bioassay-guided fractionations of
    <i>
     Boophone disticha
    </i>
    (Amaryllidaceae) lead to the isolation and identification of two alkaloids, buphanadrine and buphanamine with affinity for SERT (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Sandager et al., 2005</a>
    ). Structurally, buphanamine and buphanadrine have the benzo-1,3-dioxole moiety in common with the clinically used SSRI paroxetine, which could explain their affinity to the SERT. The traditional use and reported hallucinogenic effects obtained after accidental or purposeful overdosing with
    <i>
     Boophone disticha
    </i>
    extracts (
    <a href="#block-22-0">De Smet, 1996</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-23-0">van Wyk et al., 2002</a>
    ) indicate that the alkaloids reach the CNS.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="page" data-page-id="19">
   <p>
    The activity of these alkaloids inspired further screening of several Amaryllidaceae alkaloids in the SERT binding assay (

    ) in the [

    ]-citalopram binding assay. Cherylline shares some structural similarities to sertraline and 4-(indol-3-yl)piperidine type SSRIs, which could explain the high affinity of the compound. Epivittatine (
    <math>
     IC_{50} = 12.1 \mu M
    </math>
    ), powelline and martidine (
    <math>

    5.1. Age-related dementia and debilitating mental disorders in southern Africa
   </h3>
   <p>
    The increasing average life expectancy is leading to major demographic changes worldwide. CNS disorders associated with old age, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), and other 'senile' dementia will have dramatic soci
    <a href="#block-22-0">eta</a>
    l and economic impact in the next decades (
    <a href="#block-24-0">World H</a>
    ealth
    <a href="#block-24-0">Report, 1</a>
    998). The number of elderly people in Africa is increasing very rapidly. Figures from the UN Project Life expectancy in Africa to increase from under 40 years in 1950 to almost 60 years in 2010 (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Ineichen, 2</a>
    000), however, due to HIV life expectancy in southern Africa, which reached 59 years in the early 1990s, is expected to fall to 45 years by 2010. In South Africa life expectancy was 45 years (1950–1955) and rose to currently around 58 years (1995–2000) but is expected to drop again over the next decade to 56 years (
    <a href="#block-24-0">United N</a>
    ations,
    <a href="#block-24-0">2003).</a>
   </p>
   <p>
    The HIV epidemic is further complicated by the development of a subcortical dementing illness known as AIDS dementia complex (ADC) (Guillemain
    <a href="#block-22-0">and B</a>
    rew,
    <a href="#block-22-0">2007).</a>
    Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has effectively lengthened HIV infected patients' life expectancy; indeed some are approaching an age where the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is starting to become significant. Furthermore, many such patients have hyperlipidemia, which increases the risk of AD. Consequently, it has been predicted, by Guillemain
    <a href="#block-22-0">and</a>
    <a href="#block-22-0">Brew (</a>
    2007) that HIV infected patients are at an increased risk of AD or ADC.
   </p>
   <p>
    Out of the approximately 100 studies of the prevalence of dementia that have been carried out worldwide, only a small number have been conducted in Africa (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Ineichen, 1</a>
    998,
    <a href="#block-23-0">2000).</a>
    In fact very few studies hav

    ken place in developing countries, despite
   </p>
   <p>
    the fact that by 2025, an estimated 68% of the world's elderly will be living in them (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Chandra e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-22-0">al., 1</a>
    994). Hardly any epidemiological studies of mental illness in Africa have centered on dementia, or indeed on more general psychogeriatric problems.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are relatively a small number of reported African herbal treatments for age-related CNS disorders (

   <h3>
    5.2. Alzheimer's disease
   </h3>
   <p>
    In the absence of any disease (e.g. AD, hardening of arteries in the brain) a person's mental abilities are expected to remain largely intact throughout their life. Alzheimer's disease is by far the most frequent cause of dementia, increasing in prevalence from less than 1% below the age of 60 to more than 40% above the age of 85 (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Lindeboom a</a>
    nd
    <a href="#block-23-0">Weinstein, 2</a>
    004). Alzheimer's disease is a chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of the brain characterized clinically by deterioration in the key symptoms of activities of daily living, behavior, and cognition.
   </p>
   <p>
    The prevalence of AD among indigenous South African subjects is not known. Local neurologists
    <a href="#block-22-0">and</a>
    old-age psychiatrists rarely encounter the disorder (
    <a href="#block-22-0">De V</a>
    illiers
    <a href="#block-22-0">and L</a>
    ouw,
    <a href="#block-22-0">1996).</a>
    Cultural attitudes in Africa surrounding dementia may have contributed to this apparent low prevalence. One suggestion is that dementia sufferers may not survive for long. They may die quickly, from conditions such as pneumonia or diarrhoea du
    <a href="#block-22-0">e t</a>
    o the decreasing status of the elderly in the
    <a href="#block-22-0">dev</a>
    eloping world (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Chandra e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-22-0">al., 1</a>
    994;
    <a href="#block-22-0">Levkoff

     <a href="#block-22-0">a</a>
     l.,
     <a href="#block-22-0">1</a>
     995).
    </a>
    Another explanation is that dementia, like other kinds of mental illness, remains a stigmatised condition, and as such may be hidden from researchers (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Ineichen, 2</a>
    000). Given that rural communities still have difficulties in accessing tertiary health care and that memory impairment may be accepted as part of normal ageing, patients do not readily interface with clinicians (
    <a href="#block-22-0">De
     <a href="#block-22-0">
      V</a>
     illiers
     <a href="#block-22-0">a</a>

     <a href="#block-22-0">L</a>
     ouw,
     <a href="#block-22-0">1</a>
     996).
    </a>
    The demented may not even be seen as ill (De
    <a href="#block-22-0">Villiers a</a>
    nd
    <a href="#block-22-0">Louw, 1</a>
    996). Among the Tuareg of Niger, senility is believed to be a possible consequence of an old person neglecting her duty of regular prayer (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Rasmussen, 1</a>
    997).
    <a href="#block-23-0">Ihezue a</a>
    nd
    <a href="#block-23-0">Okpara (</a>
    1989) consider that mental illness is thought of as 'African' and indigenous traditional healers might be more likely to be consulted than Western-trained doctors.
   </p>
   <p>
    The cholinergic hypothesis states that the cognitive decline in AD is secondary to deficits in central cholinergic neurotransmission resulting from a loss of acetylcholine (ACh) (
    <a href="#block-24-0">Weinstock, 1</a>
    999). Of the various possible strategies for enhancing cholinergic activity in the brain, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition has been by far the most extensively used (
    <a href="#block-24-0">Weinstock,
     <a href="#block-24-0">
      1</a>
     999).
    </a>
    Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors enhance central cholinergic function by inhibiting the enzymes that degrade ACh, thereby increasing the availability of ACh to stimulate nicotinic and muscarinic receptors within the brain. Since their introduction into clinical practice, AChE inhibitors have been, and remain, the standard approach to the symptomatic treatment of AD. In the United States, these agents are the only approved pharmacologic approach shown to be effective in this disease (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Grossberg, 2</a>
    003).
   </p>
   <p>
    Understanding of the pharmacologic and toxic properties of cholinesterase inhibitors has been available for over a century (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Felter a</a>
    nd
    <a href="#block-22-0">Lloyd,</a>
    <a href="#block-22-0">1898).</a>
    Perhaps, the earliest records of toxic effects of cholinesterase inhibitors concern the perennial African plant
    <i>
     Physostigma venenosum
    </i>
    Balf. (Fabaceae). The seeds of this
   </p>

  <div class="page" data-page-id="20">
   <p>
    plant, indigenous to Calabar on the coast of Nigeria in West Africa, were used by local people for “trial by ordeal” to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused criminal. The alkaloid, physostigmine, was first isolated from
    <i>
     Physostigma venenosum
    </i>
    seeds in 1864 by Jobst and Hesse (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Lloyd, 1</a>
    897). When the clinical potential of AChE inhibitors in AD treatment was realized, it was noted that physostigmine was not suitable due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetics, notably its short half-life. Many analogous compounds were synthesized to overcome this and resulted in rivastigmine, which is now marketed by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland) (
    <a href="#block-22-0">Grossberg, 2</a>
    003). Galanthamine, an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid originally isolated from the European snowdrop (
    <i>
     Galanthus
    </i>
    L. species), is currently marketed as a hydrobromide salt under the name Razadyne®, formerly Reminyl®, for the treatment of AD. For an elegant and comprehensive review of the discovery and development of this drug consult

    Differences in AChE inhibitory activity could be related to structural differences, in particular different ring types. Lycorine-type alkaloids were the most active against AChE with 1-O-acetylylcocine (
    <math>
     IC_{50} = 0.96 \mu M
    </math>
    ) exhibiting inhibitory activity comparable to that of galanthamine. The inhibitory activity of the alkaloids lycorine and 1,2 di-O-acetylylcocine was 100-times less potent than that of 1-O-acetylylcocine (

    <math>

    <a href="#block-23-0">Okubadejo e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-22-0">al., 2</a>
    006). Much of the variation has been attributed to methodological differences of studies, but genetic and environmental diversity may be contributory (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Okubadejo, 2</a>
    008).
   </p>
   <p>
    To date PD remains an incurable disease. The currently available pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are able to offer only symptomatic relief for patients (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Katzung, 2</a>
    001). Symptoms can be managed with several different drugs most of which

    either boost the levels of dopamine in the brain or mimic the effects of dopamine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because dopamine is preferentially deaminated by MAO-B in the human brain, MAO-B inhibitors should increase the basal central dopamine levels in patients with Parkinson's disease. The MAO-B inhibitor selegiline was developed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease based on this hypothesis (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Knoll, 2</a>
    000). MAO-B inhibition also has neuroprotective effects. Since the oxidation step catalyzed by MAO-B yields reactive hydrogen peroxide as a by-product of amine turnover, the generated hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species may cause deterioration in neuronal function or eventually lead to neuronal death. MAO inhibitors reduce oxidant stress by limiting the formation of this reactive species and, hence, may contribute to the control of the aging process (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Knoll,
     <a href="#block-23-0">
      2</a>
     000).
    </a>
    The enzymatic activity of MAO-B increases with age, and is particularly high around senile plaques (
    <a href="#block-24-0">Yamada a</a>
    nd
    <a href="#block-24-0">Yasuhara, 2</a>

    t
    <a href="#block-24-0">al., 2</a>
    006). Due to the disadvantage of the side effects associated with the traditional non-selective irreversible MAOIs (e.g. 'cheese effect') coupled with the potential therapeutic value of new inhibitors that are reversible and selective towards either MAO-A or MAO-B, the search for new MAO inhibitors is validated (

   <p>
    Naringenin, a flavonoid was later isolated from a 70% ethanol extract of
    <i>
     Mentha aquatica
    </i>
    , an indigenous mint to Africa and Europe, by bioassay-guided isolation using the same continuous peroxidase-linked photometric assay (
    <a href="#block-23-0">Olsen e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-23-0">al., 2</a>
    008). The
    <math>
     IC_{50}
    </math>
    values for MAO inhibition by naringenin were found to be
    <math>
     342 \pm 33 \mu

    M for the rat liver mitochondrial fraction,
    <math>
     955 \pm 129 \mu

    M for MAO-A and
    <math>
     288 \pm 18 \mu
    </math>
    M for MAO-B. It has been considered doubtful whether plant constituents, especially flavonoids, are able to reach the brain. Naringenin has been shown to pass the blood–brain barrier (
    <a href="#block-24-0">Youdim

    </a>
    which means that it can exert an effect on the CNS. Naringenin has been shown to have many effects outside the CNS, such as being a cancer chemopreventive agent, a mutagenic inhibitor, a genotoxicology inhibitor, and having antioxidant, hypocholesterolic, antibacterial, antiviral, antiallergic, antiangiogenic, apoptotic and cytostatic activity (

    This non-selectivity might limit the compound's clinical use.

   <h3>
    5.6. Conclusions
   </h3>
   <p>
    Using ethnobotanical knowledge as a guide in deciding which southern African plants to screen for the treatment of age-related CNS ailments is perhaps not the best option, due to the relatively small number of such traditional treatments. Taxonomic based decisions, such as screening southern African Amaryllidaceae for AChE inhibitors, on the knowledge that European genera have given promising candidates, may be more successful. To date only one alkaloid, 1-O-acetyllycorine from
    <i>
     Crinum moorei
    </i>
    Hook.f., has shown activity comparable to that exhibited by galanthamine. Perhaps further studies on other Amaryllidaceae genera, such as
    <i>
     Apodolirion
    </i>
    Baker,
    <i>
     Brunsvigia
    </i>
    Heist.,
    <i>
     Cyrtanthus
    </i>
    Aiton,
    <i>
     Gethyllis
    </i>
    L.,
    <i>
     Haemanthus
    </i>
    L. and
    <i>
     Strumaria
    </i>
    Jacq. ex Willd. may yield novel alkaloids with promising activity.

   <p>
    Steroidal alkaloids of members of the Buxaceae,

    Lindl. and
    <i>

   <h2>
    6. Concluding remarks
   </h2>
   <p>
    In this review we have seen that a number of plants used in traditional medicine for mental health problems have shown activity in bioassays for selected targets matching their traditional usage. For the plants used for dementia and age-related problems, inhibition of the enzymes acetylcholinesterase or monoamine oxidase B seems to be the mechanisms of action, whereas the plants used for epilepsy and convulsion, and for depression, might influence more than one type of receptor system. Several plants seem to hold potential for further investigation
    <a href="#block-23-0">and d</a>
    evelopment for treatment of depression, where both
    <i>
     in vitro
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     in vivo
    </i>
    studies support activity.
   </p>
   <p>
    In some cases the active constituents have been isolated and structures elucidated. This has made it possible to gain further information on how the compounds act. QSAR studies on Amaryllidaceae alkaloids isolated from
    <i>
     Crinum
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Cyrtanthus
    </i>
    species has revealed a possible new mechanism of action. One of the alkaloids, 1-O-acetyllycorine, was more active than galanthamine, currently in clinical use, which indicate potential for further development.
   </p>
   <p>
    Knowledge of active constituents opens up a possibility for development of standardized products, which would help secure a more reliable medication for patients. This could be a business opportunity for companies developing traditional medicine products. Overall, the findings reported in this review yield credibility to some of the practices used in South African traditional medicine in the treatment of mental illness.
