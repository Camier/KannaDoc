    ABSTRACT
   </h2>
   <p>
    Sub-Saharan Africa has rich ethnobotanical heritage of public health relevance within pluralistic systems of perinatal care. Compiling of reported medicinal plant use during pregnancy and postpartum from historical and contemporary sources allowed for analyses directed at i) identification of the most important taxa in relation to key functional purposes, ii) establishing patterns of use, and iii) testing the hypothesis that perinatal plant use is non-random.
   </p>
   <p>
    Data from 410 publications generated 5979 use reports related to 2122 species from 181 plant families, with 53% of reports published from 2005 to 2020. New species continue to be added at a constant rate. With 86% (67/78) of perinatal-focused papers published since 2005, purposeful research contributes to an increase in overall data availability. For analysis, reports were categorized as i) uterotonic (
    <math>
     n = 2596
    </math>
    ), ii) prenatal (
    <math>
     n = 1778
    </math>
    , 555 specifically for preventing miscarriage or delaying the onset of labor), iii) lactation and postpartum recovery (
    <math>
     n = 1194
    </math>
    , 812 as galactagogues), or iv) newborn and infant health (
    <math>
     n = 1018
    </math>
    ). Most frequently reported species per category are discussed in relation to published pharmacological data. Based on congruence among linear regression, negative binomial regression, Bayesian, and Imprecise Dirichlet Model statistics, non-random use includes preference for i) latex-producing families during lactation and postpartum, ii) families differentiating tocolytic and general pregnancy application, and iii) Crassulaceae species for infant umbilicus healing. Significant underuse of the Rubiaceae throughout the perinatal, and for the Apocynaceae and Euphorbiaceae during pregnancy and parturition specifically, suggests avoidance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Traditional plant knowledge remains relevant to the health and social well-being of Sub-Saharan African populations. Within pluralistic systems, documentation of traditional practices can contribute to complementary approaches and the mediation of potential conflicts with conventional healthcare. Refinement of quantitative and qualitative methodologies for documenting perinatal knowledge, beliefs, and practices can further understanding of the congruence among sociocultural, ecological, molecular, behavioral, and health aspects of women's perinatal use of medicinal plants.

    knowledge of medicinal plants used during the perinatal period represents past and present selection, presumably guided by physiological properties related to well-defined functional outcomes necessary for reproductive success, as well as by cognitive, ecological, and cultural determinants (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Weckerle et al., 2011</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    In ethnobotanical inventories, perinatal indications of particular taxa are usually diffused among many other medicinal uses, although a growing number of reviews and primary studies focus on reproductive health more specifically (

   <p>
    The current analysis undertakes to assemble an extensive database of published reports of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) perinatal plant knowledge from historical and contemporary sources. Compilations of ethnomedical information at the end of the 20th century (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Ayensu, 1978</a>

    ) drew on knowledge recorded in the colonial and immediate post-colonial periods, primarily by non-Africans. The subsequent explosion of ethnobotanical investigations (

    ;
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van</a>
    <a href="#block-19-3">Wyk, 2015</a>
    ) led by scientists with direct links to the societies and communities they study has expanded and enriched the knowledge base.
   </p>
   <h3>
    1.2. Perinatal medicinal plant use in traditional and contemporary health
   </h3>
   <p>
    Traditional use of plants and the expertise of Traditional Birth Attendants (TBA) remain essential for primary health of underserved populations in rural and other areas of SSA (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Garces et al., 2019</a>
    ). Although urbanization paralleled by increasing access to modern facilities and skilled professionals profoundly changes perinatal healthcare, across the region some 40% of births occur outside of health facilities (
    <a href="#block-19-3">UNICEF, 2021</a>
    ), with many women integrating medicinal plants with modern perinatal care (
    <a href="#block-18-0">Nega et al., 2019</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-16-3">Beyene and Beza, 2018</a>
    ). Similarly, contemporary prevalence of medicinal plant use during pregnancy across different African sub-regions lies minimally within the range of 30–45% (
    <a href="#block-15-17">Ahmed et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-15-17">2018</a>
    ). Recent reviews identify contemporary research on medicinal plant use during pregnancy as well as key species (
    <a href="#block-15-17">Ahmed et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-15-17">2018</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-16-3">El Hajj and Holst, 2020</a>
    ). Traditional plants used during lactation and the postnatal period have been compiled and reviewed globally including from Africa (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko and Johns, 2021</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-18-3">2021</a>
    ). Population surveys that focus on prevalence of overall use of medicinal plants, primarily in conjunction with healthcare services and/or including urban and middle-class new mothers, do not fully represent the depth and breadth of traditional African medicinal knowledge or practice.
   </p>
   <p>
    The manner in which women traditionally use plants corresponds with medically recognized stages of pregnancy, labor, and recovery, and with pharmacological mechanisms associated with agents known to mediate these stages (de Boer and Cottingting, 2014). Functional categories that define the field and our analysis include: uterotonic (abortifacient, parturition facilitation, hemorrhage cessation, placenta expulsion); tocolytic (anti-miscarriage, labor onset delay); general health during pregnancy; pain relief; lactation and postpartum recovery (galactagogues, physical and mental health); and newborn care and health of breastfeeding infants. Within pluralistic health systems, consideration of pharmacological and toxicological activities of medicinal plants in a sociocultural context can guide complementary application, as well as appropriate intervention where traditional practices are potentially harmful.
   </p>
   <h3>
    1.3. Non-random selection of plants used perinatally
   </h3>
   <p>
    We use secondary data analysis to address the question whether plant use during the perinatal period reflects specific choice, either by an individual or as embedded in shared cultural knowledge. The non-random theory of medicinal plant selection (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Robles Arias et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-18-3">2020</a>
    ) draws on the assumption that physiological and pharmacological activities are attributable to phytochemicals, presumably associated with common taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships. Cognitive, ecological, and cultural historical factors may be at least as important in influencing selection decisions (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Weckerle et al., 2011</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-18-3">Savo et al., 2015</a>
    ). Tests of the non-random hypothesis typically
   </p>
   <p>
    compare the number of species per plant family used medicinally within a sample with the number of total species for each of the families in the flora from which the data are obtained. In investigations from different global regions (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk, 2020</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-17-3">Moerman et al., 1999</a>
    ) and local-scale surveys (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Robles Arias et al., 2020</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-17-3">Muleba et al., 2021</a>
    ) families are identified that are utilized more or less than expected on a random basis. The linear regression approach introduced by Moerman (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Moerman et al., 1999</a>
    ) has been refined using contingency table/binomial analysis (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Bennett and Husby, 2008</a>
    ), negative binomial (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Robles Arias et al., 2020</a>
    ), Bayesian (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Weckerle et al., 2011</a>
    ), and imprecise probability calculation (using the Imprecise Dirichlet Model (IDM)) (
    <a href="#block-19-0">Weckerle et al., 2012</a>
    ) methods. Although methodological strengths and limitations have been debated (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Savo et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-18-3">2015</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-17-3">Leonti et al., 2012</a>
    ), such studies can generate explanatory insights and hypotheses. Mapping onto molecular phylogenies can further discern the basis for plant selection for medicinal use (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Gras</a>
    <a href="#block-17-3">et al., 2021</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-18-3">Pedrosa et al., 2021</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Directly applicable to the SSA scale of the current paper is a recent floristic analysis by
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk (2020)</a>
    which used linear regression, Bayesian, and IDM methods to identify medically over- and under-used plant families. We compare our data to that used by van Wyk and extend the analysis to i) include negative binomial regression and ii) consider relative importance for families, genera, and species based on frequency of published reports across perinatal categories. Among the limitations of non-random approaches are the floristic reality that species within a family are not evenly distributed or available within an environment (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Robles Arias et al., 2020</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-18-3">Pedrosa et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-18-3">2021</a>
    ); as well existing flora may be only relatively representative (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Savo et al., 2015</a>
    ). Frequency of reported use, as it corresponds to both preference for attributes of particular taxa but also to accessibility, provides a measure of the degree to which taxa are relied on in actual practice. On the other hand, failure to utilize taxa that are accessible and/or used medicinally in other contexts suggests selective avoidance during the perinatal.

    1.4. Objectives summary
   </h3>
   <p>
    The primary objective of this paper involves compilation of a thorough bibliography and inventory on perinatal plant use in SSA. Analysis of these data seeks to identify the most important taxa in relation to different functional purposes, establish patterns of use, and test the hypothesis that perinatal plant use is non-random. Where available, the functional basis of selection decisions is supported through review of pharmacological investigations. Concurrently, we provide a case study of historical trends and status of ethnomedical data collection in SSA.

   <h3>
    2.1. Comprehensive review and secondary data analysis
   </h3>
   <p>
    We undertook a review (
    <a href="#block-2-0">Fig. 1</a>
    ) of plants used during the perinatal period in relation to health of mothers and infants. The period of interest extends from the onset of pregnancy until approximately six months after parturition (period of postpartum recovery and pre-weaning lactation). Data were obtained from primary ethnobotanical studies plus compilations and reviews that cite reference sources. Available compilations (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Ayensu, 1978</a>
    ; Biegel and Farnsworth, 1994;

    ) cover information published before 2000, including resources not included in electronic databases (primarily before 1974) and generally unavailable electronically. We searched CAB Abstracts (OVID), Medline (OVID), Scopus, and Web of Science databases for primary ethnobotanical studies, surveys, and reviews published from the beginning of databases to 2020.

    Ethnobotanical studies typically report general medicinal plant use data collected from informant interviews associated with an identified population or group of informants. In order to avoid bias towards particular plants or aspects of perinatal health we excluded studies focused on 1) specific plant families, genera, or species, and 2) diseases or health conditions other than relevant to the perinatal period. Additionally, we excluded 3) infertility treatments, and 4) treatment of only animals, although some relevant human studies overlap with veterinary medicine.

    Primary database search terms were 'medicinal plants' OR 'ethnobotany' cross-referenced with 'Sub-Saharan Africa' OR names of each of the countries in SSA, with NOT terms used to exclude specific disease conditions.

Data recorded included taxonomic information, plant part used, nature of publication, year of publication, geographical location (usually country), and medicinal purpose. Data were further categorized by perinatal period and mechanistic function. Data were tabulated as number of URs and ranked in relation to 4 categories: i) prenatal (pregnancy support, miscarriage prevention), ii) uterotonic (parturition, immediate postpartum, abortifacient), iii) lactation and postpartum recovery, and iv) health of newborns and breastfeeding infants.

   <h3>
    2.3. Non-random selection
   </h3>
   <p>
    Four analytical methods were employed to cross-examine patterns of perinatal plant medicine selection: 1) simple linear regression, 2) negative binomial regression, 3) Bayesian, and 4) Imprecise Dirichlet Modeling (IDM). Firstly, we explored the relationship between number of species in SSA plant families (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk, 2020</a>
    ) with the number of species per family used for perinatal medicine, running separate analyses for the subcategories: i) prenatal, ii) uterotonic, iii) lactation and postpartum recovery, iv) infant health. Secondly, we examined the relationship between number of recorded medicinal species in SSA plant families (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk, 2020</a>
    ) with the number of species per family used for perinatal medicine, again separated for usage subcategories. STATA 17.0 (
    <a href="#block-18-3">StataCorp, 2021</a>
    ) was used for linear and binomial regression, and Excel was used for Bayesian and IDM analyses.
   </p>
   <p>
    Regression analyses modeled i) the total number of SSA plant species per family as the independent variable, and ii) the second series modeled the total number of SSA medicinal plant species per family as the independent variable, with number of species per family used for perinatal medicine (different for each usage subcategory) the dependent variable for each model. Families with studentized residuals falling above the 95th and 97.5th percentile of the
    <i>
     t
    </i>
    -distribution were considered overused and most overused, respectively, and families with studentized residuals falling below the 5th and 2.5th percentile were considered underused and most underused, respectively. Studentized residuals follow Student's
    <i>
     t
    </i>
    -distribution and are more appropriate than raw residuals for identifying outliers (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Robles Arias et al., 2020</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-18-3">Savo et al., 2015</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    The Bayesian approach followed methods described by
    <a href="#block-19-3">Weckerle</a>
    <a href="#block-19-3">et al. (2011)</a>
    ; we assumed a Uniform (0,1) prior distribution and used Excel's Inverse beta function and formulas defined by Weckerle et al. to calculate the 95% posterior credible interval of the overall proportion of perinatal plant species used in each of the perinatal usage subcategories, which we compared to the corresponding credible interval for each family. Families were considered underused or overused if their credible interval fell below or above the overall credible interval, respectively. The IDM methods and formulas as described by
    <a href="#block-19-0">Weckerle et al. (2012)</a>
    are similar to the Bayesian approach, but instead of a specific prior distribution applied the parameter value of
    <math>
     s = 4
    </math>
    which allowed for a wide possibility of priors.

    3. Results
   </h2>
   <h3>
    3.1. Review and data compilation
   </h3>
   <p>
    Data were collected from 410 publications (Appendix B) (392 primary sources, 18 compilations) and, after cross-referencing sources among compilations, were consolidated to 5979 URs (Appendix A). Compilations accounted for 35.8% (
    <math>
     n = 2140
    </math>
    ) of URs, with 64.2% (
    <math>
     n = 3839
    </math>
    ) from primary ethnobotanical studies and population level surveys. 52.6% of the URs were published in the previous 15 years (2005–2020) representing a strong acceleration in population-level studies since 2005 (Fig. 2). While family and genera are leveling off towards stable asymptotes (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Williams et al., 2007</a>
    ), accumulation curves (not shown) demonstrate that new species continue to be reported at a constant rate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Of the 392 primary studies from which data were obtained, 78 focusing specifically on the perinatal period accounted for 1858 URs (mean= 23.8). The remaining 336 primary studies with 1980 URs averaged only 5.9 per publication. Furthermore, 178 ethnobotanical publications were excluded because they contained no perinatal data. Overall, then, the perinatal represents a small portion of data recorded in broad-spectrum ethnomedical studies. On the other hand, with 85.9% (67/78) of perinatal-focused papers published since 2005, purposeful research in this area accounts for much of the increase in overall data availability.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most URs (Appendix A) are identified to country. Regional delineation for Western and Central Africa corresponded to UN Sub-regions (
    <a href="#block-19-3">UNSD, 2021</a>
    ) while Southern Africa was expanded to include Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Eastern Africa comprised Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. Although the highest portion of the reports are from Western Africa, URs correspond broadly with current populations (
    <a href="#block-19-2">UN Population Division, 2019</a>
    ) for Western (34.5% URs, 39% population), Eastern (30.2, 32), Central (20.1, 17) and Southern (14.4, 11) regions, respectively.

   <h3>
    3.2. Pharmacological categorization
   </h3>
   <p>
    In total our data tabulated 2122 species from 181 plant families. The most reported species in each of the four perinatal categories (Appendix A) are summarized in
    <a href="#block-4-0">Table 1</a>
    . For convenience categories are arbitrarily limited to
    <math>
     \pm 20
    </math>
    , with cutoffs including all species of the lowest frequency.

    The greatest number of URs correspond to the Uterotonic category (
    <math>
     n = 2596
    </math>
    ). Of these, 1426 related specifically to parturition (inducing or facilitating labor), followed by abortifacient (
    <math>
     n = 688
    </math>
    ), expulsion of placenta (
    <math>
     n = 374
    </math>
    ), and immediate postpartum (hemorrhage, pain, expulsion of lochia) (
    <math>
     n = 290
    </math>
    ), respectively. The Prenatal category (
    <math>
     n = 1778
    </math>
    ) combines URs for general (support of a successful pregnancy from the first month until childbirth) (
    <math>
     n = 1331
    </math>
    ) use with those specifically for preventing miscarriage or delaying the onset of labor (
    <math>
     n = 555
    </math>
    ). Many plants in the category are reported simply as “pregnancy” which, while perhaps supporting health through nutrition, alleviation of nausea, or other symptoms, could also mean preventing premature adverse outcomes. “Pregnancy” and prevention of miscarriage could each correspond to tocolytic activity, but also potentially embrace a range of mechanisms including alleviation of infection (
    <a href="#block-16-0">Brown et al., 2013</a>
    ). Anti-abortive or preventing miscarriage activity was specifically attributed to 422 species, while 790 species were identified with other contributions to successful pregnancy or were ambiguous. Likewise, Lactation and Postpartum Recovery are confounded by the manner in which ethnobotanical data are translated and/or recorded in abbreviated terms (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko and Johns, 2021</a>
    ). Of the 1194 URs in this category, 812 are specifically identified as galactagogues or directly related to lactation, with 402 attributed other (specific or general) use in the postpartum period. The Newborn and Infant Health category (
    <math>
     n = 1018
    </math>
    ) included a wide range of uses ranging from specific functions such as the healing of the navel and closing of fontanelles to multiple health issues coincident with the preweaning period.

    3.3. Non-random selection
   </h3>
   <p>
    Summaries of families for which the number of species used significantly over- or under-represents that expected based on random selection are tabulated in
    <a href="#block-6-0">Table 2</a>
    . Data for individual statistical tests are provided in Appendices C-E. Consistent with previous studies (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk, 2020</a>
    ), families identified by linear regression, Bayesian and IDM approaches overlap broadly, with
   </p>
   <p>
    differences attributable to the recognized bias of linear regression to large families and greater sensitivity of the other methods to small family designation. While the negative binomial regression was generally consistent with linear regression and other methods, the largest families (with concomitant large residuals) were often non-significant, or rather than being over-represented were under-represented. Such ambiguous families are placed at the end of the lists in
    <a href="#block-6-0">Table 2</a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Our data collection method only indirectly tabulates species, with families (usually large) with multiple reports being of primary importance in relation to population health. Reports totals do vary in relation to species number (linear regression,
    <math>
     r^2 = 0.97
    </math>
    ), although notable families containing one or more widely-reported species (
    <a href="#block-4-0">Table 1</a>
    ) predically deviate from this relationship in having the largest residuals (cf. Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae, Malvaceae, Anacardiaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Caricaceae). We ask the questions as to which of the most widely-used families in perinatal care are being selected beyond i) simply their floristic presence or ii) their recognized contributions as medicinal plants in general. For each perinatal category (and the perinatal total),
    <a href="#block-6-0">Table 2</a>
    lists the families significant by regression (studentized residuals fall above 97.5th percentile or below 2.5th percentile of Student's
    <math>
     t
    </math>
    -distribution) plus additional families from Bayesian and IDM approaches (95% posterior credible interval for the family falls above or below the overall credible interval) for which report number at least equals the minimum reports corresponding to regression significance. Families are presented in rank order of reports. Smaller families over-utilized by Bayesian and IDM analyses, but contributing relatively few reports, while less important in health practice can be targets for pharmacological or other research. These are identifiable in Appendix E.
   </p>
   <p>
    The significant families do vary among categories, suggesting medicinal plant use during the perinatal period is non-random. Specific examples are discussed further below. The Solanaceae stands out as being widely over-used across categories and in the perinatal total, with the Amaranthaceae, Cucurbitaceae and Phyllanthaceae also showing cross-category perinatal use.

    Amaranthaceae, all are among the most recognized SSA medicinal families (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk, 2020</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Under-used families (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Table 2</a>
    ) are of interest as indicators of exclusion, with large ones such as Orchidaceae and Poaceae well-recognized as having relatively few medicinal species (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk, 2020</a>
    ). Here we ask the questions: i) which families are selected less than expected in relation to i) their floristic size or, but perhaps more interestingly, ii) their recognized medicinal contribution beyond perinatal application. We rank underused families identified among the tests according to i) their number of Africa species or ii) their number of reported African medicinal species. Exceptional in our data is the underuse of the Rubiaceae; that this is a family specifically overused for general medicinal application in SSA (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk, 2020</a>
    ) suggests active perinatal avoidance.
   </p>
   <h2>
    4. Discussion
   </h2>
   <p>
    A growing number of ethnobotanical studies originating in SSA over the past 15 years (
    <a href="#block-2-0">Fig. 1</a>
    , Appendix B), and the resulting accumulation of ethnomedical knowledge, provide new opportunities for secondary data analysis. In addition to documenting this heritage, knowledge compilations support theoretical and practical insights. Understanding patterns of perinatal plant use has immediate application for healthcare within the pluralistic systems that remain widespread across SSA, for prioritizing plants for ancillary research, and for understanding the physiological, ecological, cultural, and behavioral determinants of human health and disease, both past and present.
   </p>
   <h3>
    4.1. Overview of SSA perinatal medicinal plant knowledge
   </h3>
   <p>
    We tabulated reports of 2122 species, 978 genera, and 181 families with perinatal application in SSA (Appendix A). These numbers greatly exceed the 274 species (only 20 from more than one article) and 87 families previously reported from all of Africa (
    <a href="#block-15-17">Ahmed et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-15-17">2018</a>
    ). Differences can be attributed to the narrower focus of Ahmed et al. on studies documenting prevalence coincident with actual use and engagement with healthcare facilities, as well as a limit on publications from 1987 to 2017. In addition to drawing on publications from over 120 years, the current study focused broadly on knowledge reports, whether or not this coincided with documented use. Additionally, we include postpartum use of plants in our review.
   </p>
   <p>
    While the large number of taxa recorded (Appendix A) suggest that much of perinatal medicinal plant use is random, patterns identifying taxa for specific purposes (often across widespread geographical areas) support the argument that traditional knowledge is both shared and purposeful. Reproduction is defined by unambiguous outcomes and pragmatic knowledge of essential relevance to all communities. Tabulation of the data we assembled into categories that are widely recognized in traditional and scientific medicine quantitatively supports that overall use of plants during the perinatal period across SSA is non-random.
   </p>
   <h3>
    4.2. Perinatal categories: Patterns and mechanisms of plant use
   </h3>
   <h4>
    4.2.1 Prenatal
   </h4>
   <p>
    Support for health and well-being of the mother and for development of the fetus over nine months draws on a variety of potential medicinal plant activities. While several plant taxa have widespread use during this period, patterns are harder to discern. Citations may mention specific health purpose, but many others relate to just “pregnancy”. Saying something “supports a healthy pregnancy” does not differentiate general health of the mother or fetus from prevention of miscarriage.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pregnancy represents a vulnerable state for mothers, and metabolic and pathological conditions such as preeclampsia, gestational
   </p>
   <p>
    diabetes, and malnutrition lead to poor pregnancy outcomes (
    <a href="#block-16-0">Brown</a>
    <a href="#block-16-0">et al., 2013</a>
    ). Pregnancy also suppresses maternal immune system, with infection an important risk factor for miscarriage in all stages of pregnancy. Because infectious diseases present exceptional risk in SSA (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Naghavi et al., 2017</a>
    ), antimalarial, antimicrobial and related activities of medicinal plants potentially contribute to reproductive success. Other plants may offer symptom relief in relation to nausea, vomiting, hemorrhage, pain, or fever.
   </p>
   <p>
    Among the species in
    <a href="#block-4-0">Table 1A</a>
    , experimental investigations have reported tocolytic or activity mediating uterine contractions for
    <i>
     Cissampelos mucronata
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Maroyi, 2020</a>
    ),
    <i>
     Ficus exasperata
    </i>
    , and
    <i>
     Zingiber officinale
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Bafor and Kupittayanant, 2020</a>
    ). Several plants show a broad spectrum of effects relevant to the prenatal period, specifically antimicrobial, antimalarial, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and immunomodulatory activities (
    <a href="#block-9-0">Table 3</a>
    ). Meta-analyses of clinical studies support use of
    <i>
     Zingiber officinale
    </i>
    for alleviating nausea of early pregnancy (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Khorasani et al., 2020</a>
    ). The food plants
    <i>
     Abelmoschus esculentus
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Carica papaya
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Mangifera indica
    </i>
    , and
    <i>
     Manihot esculenta
    </i>
    offer nutritional benefits, while oil of
    <i>
     Elaeis guineensis
    </i>
    , as well as being a source of fatty acids, is often a vehicle for other medicinal plants (cf.
    <a href="#block-18-3">Towns and Van Andel, 2016</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Among the most widely reported families for prenatal use, the Rutaceae stands out as significant in relation to number of species in other perinatal categories (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Table 2</a>
    ) or to medicinal species in general use across SSA (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk, 2020</a>
    ). Also noteworthy is the over-use of the Menispermaceae in comparison to other perinatal categories. With the objective of distinguishing families that might be selected for preventing miscarriage from those with more general pregnancy purpose, we undertook the same statistical analyses with stratified data. Here (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Table 2</a>
    ), the Rutaceae as well as the Anacardiaceae, Caparaceae, Combretaceae, Musaceae, Phyllanthaceae, and Zingiberaceae were significant only in relation to tocolytic purposes, while the Menisiperaceae, as well as the Bignoniaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Rosaceae, and Solanaceae, were specifically significant in relation to general pregnancy use.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Apocynaceae and Euphorbiaceae are under-used in the prenatal period and overall in perinatal totals (with exceptions during the postpartum (see
    <a href="#block-9-4">Section 4.2.3</a>
    )). While both are important medicinal families in SSA (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk, 2020</a>
    ), the fact they have notable toxicity (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Alonso-Castro et al., 2017</a>
    ) may explain their relative avoidance during pregnancy and parturition.
   </p>
   <h4>
    4.2.2. Uterotonic
   </h4>
   <p>
    In addition to representing the largest portion of the URS (
    <math>
     n = 2596
    </math>
    ), uterotonic activity relates to functional outcomes specific to pregnancy and childbirth that have oxytocic and other physiological mechanisms. Several species stand out as being widely used across multiple regions (
    <a href="#block-4-0">Table 1B</a>
    ), primarily for facilitating childbirth through labor induction, acceleration, or for prolonged labor. Abortion induction, cessation of postpartum hemorrhage, and expulsion of the placenta further point to plants that may act through oxytocic mechanisms. Plants for which known oxytocic activity supports uterotonic use include
    <i>
     Bidens pilosa
    </i>
    (

    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Kaingu et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-17-3">2012</a>
    ), and
    <i>
     Vernonia amygdalina
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Attah et al., 2012</a>
    ).
    <i>
     Spondias mombin
    </i>
    has been reported to induce labor through other mechanisms (Bafor
    <a href="#block-16-3">and Kupittayanant, 2020</a>
    ).
    <i>
     Phytolacca dodecandra
    </i>
    is an effective abortifacient in rats (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Namulindwa et al., 2015</a>
    ). Evidence of anti-implantation effects may explain use of
    <i>
     Momordica charantia
    </i>
    seed (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Grover and Yadav, 2004</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-16-3">Amah and Yama, 2012</a>
    ) and
    <i>
     Ocimum gratissimum
    </i>
    (Sripriyat et al., 2011) in early abortion. For all of the above species, experimental data are of a preliminary nature and limited to
    <i>
     in vitro
    </i>
    and rodent studies.

    A number of genera are widely used across all 4 regions (cf.
    <a href="#block-13-4">Section 4.4</a>
    and
    <a href="#block-4-0">Table 1</a>
    ). On the other hand,
    <i>
     Phytolacca dodreandra
    </i>
    is mainly used in Ethiopia. At the family level the Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Urticaceae, Bignoniaceae, Pedaliaceae, and Sapindaceae stand out as reported more than expected in comparison to both total and medicinal species in the African flora. In relation to the overall flora, Malvaceae, Lamiaceae, and several less-reported families were significant in multiple tests. Euphorbiaceae, another family with large number of species and reports,
   </p>
   <p>
    was significant in comparison to total species only in linear regression. The Phytolaccaceae was significant only in the Bayesian comparison to African species, reflecting the significant use of this smaller family, particularly of the genus
    <i>
     Phytolacca
    </i>
    . This is congruent with experimental evidence supporting
    <i>
     P. dodreandra
    </i>
    , specifically, as an abortifacient. Pharmacological explanations are not readily apparent in explaining selection of other uterotonic families. The Malvaceae is mucilage producing, which as associated with a lubricant function in easing birth passage may represent doctrine of signatures; similarly, the Cucurbitaceae is characterized both by abundant phloem sap as well as bitterness. As previously noted, these families are widely used perinatally rather than specifically as uterotonic.
   </p>
   <h4>
    4.2.3. Lactation and postpartum recovery
   </h4>
   <p>
    The majority of plants utilized in relation to lactation and postpartum recovery are specifically identified as galactagogues. In
    <a href="#block-4-0">Table 1C</a>
    , 10 of the 20 most widely reported species are latex-producing and/or in families characterized by latex (Apocynaceae, Caricaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae), a pattern in SSA linked to doctrine of signatures
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="page" data-page-id="10">
   <p>
    (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Cordeiro et al., 2020</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko and Johns, 2021</a>
    ). Among over-used families, those most widely reported include latex-producing Apocynaceae, Moraceae, Sapotaceae, and Euphorbiaceae (linear regression). Both the Apocynaceae and Sapotaceae are under-used among African medicinal plants as uterotonic and in the prenatal category, with the Euphorbiaceae also under-used prenatally (
    <a href="#block-8-6">Section 4.2.1</a>
    ), suggesting their selection for postpartum and lactation application is highly specific. Conversely, among the under-used families in the postpartum category are two of the most important African medicinal families (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Van Wyk, 2020</a>
    ), Annonaceae and Rubiaceae, suggesting active avoidance.
   </p>
   <p>
    Other forms of doctrine of signatures are evident in the association by shape of fruits of
    <i>
     Kigelia africana
    </i>
    or
    <i>
     Carica papaya
    </i>
    with female breasts, while immature seeds of
    <i>
     Arachis hypogaea
    </i>
    have a milky endosperm. Just because a plant is associated with doctrine of signatures does not mean it cannot have pharmacological properties with functional significance. Indeed, doctrine of signatures can be a mnemonic device for communicating important information about medicinal plants (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Bennett, 2007</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-17-3">Leonti et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-17-3">2002</a>
    ). In a region with historically high prevalence of infectious disease, the actuality that many plants used postpartum in SSA have anti-infectious and related activities supports their potential contributions to immediate and long-term health (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Cordeiro et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-16-3">2020</a>
    ). Many phytochemicals pass into breastmilk with sensory implications suggesting that
    <i>
     in utero
    </i>
    and postnatal exposure to bitter constituents offers an important learning pathway for child acceptance of various forms of medicinal plants, of lifelong significance in SSA (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko et al., 2021</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Maternal ingestion of phytochemicals during the postpartum period has importance for immunological and other aspects of infant development as well as for maternal health and well-being (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko</a>
    <a href="#block-18-3">et al., 2021</a>
    ).
    <a href="#block-11-0">Table 4</a>
    summarizes the anti-infectious, anti-inflammatory, immunological, nervous system, galactagogue, and toxicological activities relevant to the postpartum period.
   </p>
   <p>
    These species lack convincing demonstration of galactagogue activity (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Cordeiro et al., 2020</a>
    ), but their anti-infectious, analgesic, and sedative activities offer immediate potential benefit to the mother. Although anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunological, and antimicrobial phytochemicals from African medicinal plants potentially mediate infant health and development, investigation of their presence in breastmilk and infant lumen and blood, as well as activity on infant microbiome, development, and behavior is required (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko et al., 2021</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Contributions of maternally-ingested phytochemicals to development of the breastfeeding infant coincides with an apparent overlooked traditional comprehension of galactagogues in relation to milk quality - opposed to quantity as per how the concept is classically defined (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko and Johns, 2021</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko et al., 2021</a>
    ).
    <a href="#block-17-3">Jendras et al. (2020)</a>
    advance this notion in a survey among the BaKongo in Northern Angola that identified 33 species for “cleansing” mothers’ milk. Functional contribution of antimicrobial properties is central to their interpretation of this pattern. The (only) 21 additional URs we encountered (Appendix A) that identify plants used to “purify” or otherwise improve milk quality suggest, on one hand, that similar concepts are part of traditional perinatal knowledge in Central, Eastern and Western Africa, but perhaps more significantly that the recording and tabulation of this aspect of women’s knowledge has in the past lacked the nuance that becomes possible when research focuses specifically on breastfeeding or the perinatal period.

    4.2.4. Newborn and infant health
   </h4>
   <p>
    Newborn and infant health covers a range of health conditions and medicinal plants. As summarized in
    <a href="#block-13-4">Table 5</a>
    , the largest portion of URs correspond to conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (colic, diarrhea, constipation, et cetera) (18.2%). Although information is
   </p>
   <p>
    typically recorded in a sparse manner, we assume infectious agents are relevant for a majority of this category. Together with respiratory disease (2.0%) and an array of specific infectious conditions (Other (12.2%)), infectious categories represent 32.4% of the URs. Additionally, many dermatological reports (4.6%) reinforce the assumption that infectious agents are the target of at least a third of the medicinal plant applications related to newborn and infant health (also cf. fontanelles and umbilical healing). 17.7% of reports are explicitly related to fontanelles, either for facilitating closure of cranial sutures or for treating sunken or bulging fontanelles, conditions symptomatic of underlying dehydration or fever (possibly of infectious etiology (Kies
    <a href="#block-17-3">ler and Ricer, 2003</a>
    )). Application of plants to facilitate healing of the navel or detachment of the umbilical cord was recorded at 8%. 19.5% of URs fall into the strengthening category. A large portion of these are specifically identified as tonics or described in general terms (16.9%), with a small number specifically designated as nutritional or promoting growth (2.5%). Cleaning the newborn or infant (typically bathing) and nervous and behavior concerns (e.g., convulsions, crying) (3.9%), plus a number of miscellaneous conditions (9.2%), complete the categories.
   </p>
   <p>
    As evidenced by
    <a href="#block-4-0">Table 1D</a>
    and Appendix A, individual plants generally lack specific association with any one of the above indications, with the most frequently reported plants summarized broadly for “infant care”. An exception is the use of plants to support healing of the umbilicus, with the family Crassulaceae standing out in Western, Eastern, and Central regions. For the most frequently reported species,
    <i>

    investigations support wound-healing and related antibacterial, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Fernandes et al., 2019</a>

    Among over-used taxa, Asteraceae and Crassulaceae stand out for infant use in contrast to being generally under-used in African medicinal families (

    4.3. Toxicity
   </h3>
   <p>
    Toxicity data related to Lactation and Postpartum Recovery (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Table 4</a>
    ) provide an overall pattern suggesting most plants presented in
    <a href="#block-4-0">Table 1C</a>
    are probably safe as used (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Cordeiro et al., 2020</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko</a>
    <a href="#block-18-3">and Johns, 2021</a>
    ). Although potential benefit during the postnatal period appears to exceed risk, adequate studies generally are lacking. Cases that raise specific concerns and calls for further investigation include:
    <i>
     Aframomum melegueta
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Cynanchum viminale
    </i>

    Such deficiency of data is more problematic related to plant use during pregnancy, particularly the 1st trimester, or when administered directly to infants. Of prenatal plants (

   <p>
    While a few iconic species have widespread utilization during the perinatal period (
    <a href="#block-4-0">Table 1</a>
    ), in many instances selection appears to be at the level of genus and family. Generic-level selection in the perinatal period is consistent with observations that traditional pharmacopoeias tend to draw from widespread and species-rich taxa (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Leonti</a>

   <h3>
    4.5. Non-random selection
   </h3>
   <p>
    Non-random association at the level of family or genus indicates selection based on shared genetic traits. However, this does not differentiate a physiological or pharmacological rationale from culturally and cognitively mediated mechanisms such as doctrine of signatures, nor from ecological or historical factors (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Savo et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-18-3">2015</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-19-3">Weckerle et al., 2011</a>
    ). That use related to perinatal health extends over many families tends to reinforce the reality that many phytochemical pathways are widespread, or that different classes of phytochemicals can exhibit similar functional activities. Molecular phylogenetic methods offer potential for deeper examination of SSA perinatal selection patterns, either by discerning functional domains within a family or generic level phylogenetic tree of a predefined flora (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Gras et al., 2021</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-19-3">Yessoufou et al., 2015</a>
    ), or mapping categories defined by ethnobotanical use against phylogenetic trees constructed from taxa found in the dataset (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Pedrosa et al., 2021</a>
    ). Promising trends involving medicinal plants have been demonstrated in several contexts. Phylogenetic signals are often weak (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Pedrosa et al., 2021</a>
    ) but demonstrate the importance of further methodological development and exploration of ethnobotanically-applicable best practices (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Saslis-Lagoudakis, 2011</a>
    ,
    <a href="#block-18-3">2012</a>
    ). An exploration of the flora of Mt. Kilimanjaro found clusters of medicinal species within multiple domains scattered over the phylogenetic tree that the authors speculated could be “disease-specific” (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Molina-Venegas et al., 2020</a>
    ). In a phylogenetic analysis at the genus level of the Cape flora of South Africa, commonly used medicinal plants categorized by indication (
    <a href="#block-19-3">Yessoufou et al., 2015</a>
    ) were not clustered, although in one metric a significant effect was seen for facilitation of childbirth (but not abortion). In a study in Catalan-speaking territories, pregnancy, birth and puerperal disorders was one of three (of 15) medicinal groups producing a robust hot node (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Gras et al., 2021</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <h3>
    4.6. Gender specific knowledge
   </h3>
   <p>
    Greater attention globally to the gender specific nature of traditional knowledge and to women's particular expertise in relation to reproduction and children's health is reflected in SSA by unprecedented publication of perinatal-focused publications during this time period. Although these are only 10% (67/639) of the total of sources for our data (primary studies reviewed (
    <math>
     n = 392
    </math>
    ) and sources identified in compilations (
    <math>
     n = 247
    </math>
    )), alone they account for more than 30% of the URs we tabulated. Novel data and insights afforded by this focus on women's knowledge in the perinatal period (cf.
    <a href="#block-17-3">Jendras</a>
    <a href="#block-17-3">et al., 2020</a>
    ) supports the need for comparative research guided by hypothesis-guided assessment of knowledge gaps and attention to methodological best practices (
    <a href="#block-18-3">Sibeko et al., 2021</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    While some investigations are definitive in identifying women as conveyors of the information reported, much of the information tabulated (Appendix A) is only circumstantially attributable to women. This is particularly true of older reports or compiled data. Contemporary ethnobotanical studies usually characterize the population of informants in terms of age (range, mean) and gender, but often state number or relative portions of women and men, rather than disaggregating use reports specifically contributed by women. Comparative exploration of knowledge patterns of women and men (including spouses), or among women of different parity status and age directed at questions concerning knowledge transfer and behavioral determinants of child-rearing success (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Cordeiro et al., 2020</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-18-3">Scelza and Hinde,</a>
    <a href="#block-18-3">2019</a>
    ), are not possible with these data. Knowledge and roles of grandmothers and women elders (
    <a href="#block-16-3">Dlisani and Bhat, 1999</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-17-3">Jendras</a>
    <a href="#block-17-3">et al., 2020</a>
    ) including TBAs, their participation during the perinatal period, and patterns and mode of inter-generational and community knowledge transfer, are issues raised sometimes in the literature we reviewed. Systematic investigations of these questions are called for.
   </p>
   <h3>
    4.7. Secular trends
   </h3>
   <p>
    Qualitative observation points to several notable species that only appear in the published record (Appendix A) recently. This could reflect either changes in the nature of research conducted or in actual patterns of use across the region. In the case of
    <i>
     Linum usitatissimum
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Ruta chalepensis
    </i>
    , first appearing in 2003 and 2009 respectively, the fact all reports are Ethiopian likely relates to the upsurge of ethnobotanical research in a culturally and ecologically unique country that had been previously under-represented. More widespread species recently introduced to the perinatal record include
    <i>
     Allium sativum
    </i>
    (garlic) (2007),
    <i>
     Azadirachta indica
    </i>
    (2008), and
    <i>
     Mangifera indica
    </i>
    (2010). All records of
    <i>
     Cocos nucifera
    </i>
    as a galactagogue appear after 2009. With the exception of two early (1936, 1964) references on
    <i>
     Zingiber officinale
    </i>
    (ginger) as a galactagogue from Tanzania, all other references are from 2007 or later. That four of these species (
    <i>
     A. sativum
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     A. indica
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     R. chalepensis
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Z. officinale
    </i>
    ) overlap with the most widely reported species in
    <a href="#block-15-17">Ahmed et al. (2018)</a>
    reinforces secular trends, but may also reflect bias in current medicinal plant research towards studies coincident with access to healthcare facilities.
   </p>
   <p>
    Adoption of well-known species across the region coincides with demographic and economic trends that reflect globalization of medicinal plant use, and presumably concomitant erosion of African traditional knowledge. The fact that garlic and ginger (the top 2 species recorded by Ahmed et al.) are the only plants in
    <a href="#block-4-0">Table 1</a>
    for which clinical data is available to support safety during pregnancy, reflects a pattern where culturally mediated behaviors are mediated by global socioeconomic influences and access to scientific expertise.
   </p>
   <h3>
    4.8. Limitations
   </h3>
   <p>
    Although data analyses leading to
    <a href="#block-4-0">Tables 1</a>
    and
    <a href="#block-6-0">2</a>
    weighs all URs tabulated in Appendix A equally, the extended time frame from
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="page" data-page-id="15">
   <p>
    which we tabulated perinatal knowledge diminishes data comparability in several regards. In the first instance are differences between compilations and primary studies. Methodological details provided in the latter usually allows for adequate understanding of the nature of data recorded. Newer studies more likely adhere to current best practices in providing fulsome details on informants (age, gender, ethnicity) and communities, as well as methods of data collection, although format and details of presentation is variable in quality and often open to interpretation. Taxonomic presentation, including collection of herbarium specimens, expertise of those responsible for identification, and/or taxonomic authority of the names given is many times deficient. We have not applied criteria ascertaining quality that could screen out data of lesser validity.
   </p>
   <p>
    For older data, methods of collection, source community, and informant characteristics are often non-specific and non-verifiable. Seldom is it possible to validate herbarium specimens and species identification. Older publications and compilations may be citing the same sources which presents a challenge for dereplicating data. On the other hand, older references may consolidate data from more than one source, meaning that they do not fully represent the richness of knowledge across multiple communities or informants, or across time. Moreover, compilations are sometimes selective and not thorough in presenting all of the original reports they draw from. In other instances, they can be mutually contradictory or misrepresent the original sources.
   </p>
   <h2>
    5. Conclusion
   </h2>
   <p>
    High prevalence of maternal health care outside of formal facilities and concurrent use of medicinal plants underlines the public health relevance of research in this area. Publication explosion of SSA medicinal plant use demonstrates that traditional plant knowledge remains extant and relevant to the physical and cultural well-being of African populations.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ethnobotanical research in SSA is in an unprecedented phase of data accumulation related to traditional medicinal knowledge. Systematic review and secondary data-analysis offers insights into SSA perinatal plant use and helps identify directions for research targeted towards questions of broader import. In the first instance frequency tabulations and statistical patterns support the assessment that selection of medicinal plants is non-random. Rather, across SSA purposeful plant use that aligns with positive health outcomes is shared within a cultural context. A growing body of pharmacological data provides circumstantial evidence for the functional importance of traditional medicinal plant knowledge in achieving reproductive success. Within pluralistic African systems, documentation of traditional practices can contribute to complementary approaches and the mediation of potential conflicts with conventional healthcare.
   </p>
   <p>
    Highlighting of key plant taxa can direct analytical investigations related to perinatal health with potential for applied use or to better understanding of present and past determinants of health and well-being. Secondary data analysis can offer new insights in conjunction with refinement and development of phylogenetic and other quantitative methodologies attuned to the unique characteristics of ethnobotanical data. The manner in which studies with perinatal-specific objectives have both expanded the field and provided novel insights (
    <a href="#block-17-3">Jendras et al., 2020</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-18-3">Towns and van Andel, 2014</a>
    ,
    <a href="#block-18-3">2016</a>
    ) calls for expansion of approaches that generate comparative data. Refinement of quantitative and qualitative methodologies for eliciting detailed and in-depth knowledge concerning perinatal knowledge, beliefs, and practices are key for an integrative understanding of the congruence among sociocultural, ecological, evolutionary, molecular, behavioral, and health aspects of women's perinatal use of medicinal plants.
