## **INTRODUCTION**

The Aizoaceae (Mesembryanthemaceae) family is mostly composed of succulent plants of which 99% are found in South or Southwest of Africa. The other one-percent are found in coastal areas of Australia, New Zealand, Mediterranean area, Canary Islands, and the western coasts of Chile and California<sup>1</sup>.

Family Aizoaceae constitutes a major part of the Southern African succulent flora. With approximately 1860 species in 127 genera, and in India the family is represented by three genera, namely, *Sesuvium*, *Trianthema* and *Zaleya* with seven species distributed in the coastal and lowland areas of

peninsular India and the Gangetic plains<sup>2</sup>. It is also South Africa's second largest plant family<sup>3</sup>. Based on the division given by Bittrich & Hartmann<sup>4</sup>, five subfamilies are recognized: Aizooideae, Mesembryanthmoideae, Rushioideae, Sesuvioideae and Tetragonioideae<sup>5</sup>. In Egypt, Boulos<sup>6</sup> recognized five genera, but Hosny<sup>7</sup> listed only four genera without considering *Sesuvium*. According to Boulos<sup>6</sup> and Hosny<sup>7</sup>, *Trianthema* is represented in Egypt by two species: *T. portulacastrum* L. and either *T. triquetra* Willd. Ex Spreng. (according to Boulos<sup>6</sup>) or *T. Crystalline* (Forssk.) Vahl (according to Hosny<sup>7</sup>). *Zaleya* is represented by two species: *Z. pentandra* (L.) C. Jeffrey and *Z. decandra* (L.) Burm. f.<sup>6</sup>, or by only

{1}------------------------------------------------

one species: *Z. pentandra* (L.) C. Jeffrey<sup>7</sup>. This family is represented in Egypt by 6 genera and 10 species<sup>8</sup>. It typically inhabits dry subtropical deserts and wet tropical coasts<sup>5-9</sup>. Native species of Aizoaceae are distributed through Mediterranean coastal habitats and the Nile Valley as weeds of cultivated land, and extend to deserts.

Many members of the family are of economic importance as ornamentals and in cultivation worldwide<sup>10</sup> as some of them are used to stabilize sand dunes in coastal regions<sup>11</sup> while others are important as medicinal plants<sup>12</sup> e.g. *Tetragonia tetragonoides* is used in treatment of enteritis and stomach ache as well as stomach cancer and ulcer<sup>12</sup>. Extracts from these plants are used as preservatives, as a remedy against throat infections and in soap making<sup>13</sup>. Although Aizoaceae is considered as one of the most diverse and abundant families, it was found that it is the least studied in terms of medicinal potential<sup>14</sup>. It would, therefore, be important to extensively investigate other plants of family Aizoaceae for future drug discovery. Thus, we aimed to make a comprehensive review of the chemical constituents and biological activities of family Aizoaceae covering the articles between 1969 and 2018.

## MATERIAL AND METHODS

The research strategy employed in the review of family Aizoaceae includes internationally accepted databases like Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science as well as scientific data collected from scientific Journals.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

### Phytochemical constituents

A variety of chemicals have been isolated from different species of family Aizoaceae including; alkaloids, triterpenes, sterols, lignans, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, essential oils, and some miscellaneous compounds<sup>5-15-16</sup>.

#### Alkaloids

Mesembrine alkaloids are considered to be the primary active constituents of the South African medicinal plant *Sceletium tortuosum* (Aizoaceae), and it is used as the dried or fermented aerial material from the plant, which is known as Kanna (Aka, Channa, Kougoed). Traditional regional use ranged from relieving thirst, mild analgesia, and alteration of mood<sup>19</sup>. Only two genera of family Aizoaceae were reported to be rich with alkaloids which are genus *Sceletium* and genus *Trianthema* as shown in **Table 1**. *Sceletium spp.* is currently the only known genus having species with relatively high levels of mesembrine<sup>19</sup>, which belong to the crinane class of compounds based on the alkaloid skeleton<sup>17</sup>. Jeffs et al.

(1982) categorized the various *Sceletium* alkaloids into four structural groups: (1) the 3a-aryl-*cis*-octahydroindole class (e.g. mesembrine and the new isolated alkaloid channaine)<sup>17-18</sup>, (2) C-seco mesembrine alkaloids (e.g. joubertiamine), (3) alkaloids containing a 2,3 disubstituted pyridine moiety and 2 nitrogen atoms (e.g. *Sceletium* alkaloid A4) and (4) a ring C-seco *Sceletium* alkaloid A4 group (e.g. tortuosamine)<sup>20</sup>. The mesembrine alkaloid is the most studied of the mesembrine alkaloids due to its relative abundance in *S. tortuosum* and biological activity, it was initially partially isolated, characterized, and named by Zwicky, and it was purified and crystallized as picrate<sup>19</sup>. Mesembranol and its acetylated derivative, 4-*O*-acetylmesembrenol was also isolated together with 4-*O*-demethylmesembrenol and 4-*O*-demethylmesembranol from *Sceletium spp* in addition to mesembrenone. Joubertiamine and its derivatives represented a new structural class different from the known mesembranes. Joubertiamine, dehydrojoubertiamine, and dihydrojoubertiamine were all referred to as the seco-mesembranes and were isolated from *Sceletium joubertii*<sup>17</sup>. The preponderance of research on *Sceletium* alkaloids has revolved around isolation and structural elucidation. Very little is known about the distribution and chemotaxonomic patterns of these alkaloids within the genus<sup>17</sup>.

#### Di-, Tri-, tetra-terpenes, and sterols:

Phytochemical screening and analysis of some species of family Aizoaceae showed presence of di-, tri, and tetraterpenes.  $\beta$ - amyrin, oleanolic acid, Uvaol were isolated from the leaves' methanolic extract of *C. edulis*<sup>16</sup>, while ecdysterone, were isolated from aqueous and organic extracts of *S. portulacastrum*—and *T. portulacastrum*<sup>15-24</sup>. Pentandradione and pentandraone were isolated only from the methanolic extract of *Z. pentandra*<sup>50-51</sup>.

Sterols and their glycosides e.g. (Stigmasterol,  $\beta$ -Sitosterol, Stigmasterol 3-*O*- $\beta$ -D-glucoside and  $\beta$ -Sitosterol 3-*O*- $\beta$ -D-glucoside and the novel and recently isolated sterol 17-(5-ethyl-6-methylheptan-2-yl)-4,4,10,13-tetramethyl-hexadecahydro-1H-cyclopenta ( $\alpha$ ) phenanthren-3-ol ) have been reported to be isolated from *T. portulacastrum*<sup>15-16-21-22-24-25-26-27-28</sup> as shown in **Table 2**.

#### Lignans and neolignans:

*Aptenia cordifolia* and *T. turgidifolium* leaves are the only reported member of family Aizoaceae to show the presence of lignans and neolignans e.g. Pinorsinol, syringaresinol, di-erythro-syringylglycerol- $\beta$ -O-4,4'-syringarsinol ether and apteniol A-G were isolated from the methanolic extract of the leaves of *A. cordifolia*<sup>22-29-30-31</sup>. Isoamericanin A was isolated from *T. turgidifolium*<sup>22</sup> as shown in **Table 3**.

#### Fatty acids, and fatty alcohols:

*Sesuvium portulacastrum* is the only member of family Aizoaceae with data reported on isolates of fatty acids and fatty alcohols as shown in Table 4. It showed the presence of; Linolenic acid, oleic acid, eicosyl ester, 9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxypropyl ester, (*Z,Z,Z*)-, hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester, lauric acid, tridecanoic acid, myristic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, heptadecanoic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, nonadecanoic acid, arachidic acid, heneicosanoic acid, behenic acid, octadecanoic acid, 1-Docosanol and rhodopsin, which were isolated from dichloromethane extract of its leaves and stems<sup>11-26-32-33</sup>.

#### Catechins and phenolic acids

Reported data showed that catechins and phenolic acids were isolated from six members only of family Aizoaceae which are; *A. cordifolia*, *C. edulis*, *M. crystallinum*, *S. portulacastrum*, *T. decandra*, and *T. portulacastrum*<sup>14-21-22-25-26-29-33-34-35-36</sup>. It has been reported, that epicatechin was isolated from the organic extracts of the leaves of two different plant species *C. edulis* and *S. portulacastrum*<sup>14-21-22-25-26-29-33-34-35-36</sup>. On the other hand, we found, that 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-methylphenol is the only phenolic

compound isolated from *M. crystallinum*. Other isolated catechins and phenolic compounds are shown in Table 5.

#### Flavonoids

Several flavonoids were isolated from different species of family Aizoaceae. Rutin was isolated from the leaves ethyl acetate extract of *C. edulis* and *Mesembryanthemum forsskaolii*. Moreover, the new compound C-methyl flavone was isolated from the organic extracts of the whole plant of the two species *T. portulacastrum* and *T. decandra*<sup>11-22-24-34-37-38-39-40</sup>. Moreover, 2-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl) 3,5,7- trihydroxy-chromen-4 one was also isolated from *T. decandra*<sup>40</sup>. Other isolated compounds are shown in Table 6.

#### Betacyanin

The genus *Lampranthus* of family Aizoaceae was observed according to the reported data in Table (7) to show the presence of betacyanins. This includes *Lampranthus peersu* and *Lampranthus sociorum*. Betanin was isolated from the two plant species *Drosanthemum floribundum* and *Lampranthus spp*. Also, dopaxanthin was the only betacyanin isolated from *Glottiphyllum longum*, while  $\beta$ -Cyanin was isolated from *T. portulacastrum*<sup>24-41-42-43-44</sup>.

### Biological activities:

Members of family Aizoaceae are known to have diverse biological activities including anti-hyperlipidemic, antipyretic, diuretic, antioxidant, anticancer, larvicidal, analgesic, anti-rheumatic, anticholera, emetic, laxative, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial. As well as being used in the treatment of; skin diseases, specific blood diseases, jaundice, cataract, night blindness, heart diseases, joint pain, dropsy, ascites, edema, and others as shown in Table 11.

#### Antioxidant activity

Oxidative stress can cause damage to tissues and cells. Free radicals, such as nitric oxide, superoxide anions, and hydroxyl radicals, can result in oxidative stress and may inflict damage in almost every organ. Furthermore, cancers also can arise from excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage cellular DNA. The antioxidant potential of the following plant organic extracts: *T. portulacastrum*, *Mesembryanthemum forsskaolii*, *Aizoon canariense*,

parenchyma occupied by foci seems to suggest the anticarcinogenic potential of the plant extract in DENA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis<sup>22</sup>.

#### **Analgesic, antinociceptive, antihyperglycemic and hepatoprotective activity**

The methanol extract of the leaves of *T. portulacastrum* and *T. decandra* have remarkable analgesic, antinociceptive activity, antihyperglycemic and hepatoprotective activity<sup>22-24</sup>.

The analgesic activity of the leaf extract of *T. decandra* was detected by hot plate and acetic acid-induced writhing response method. The results indicate that the administration of leaf extract of *T. decandra* exhibit central analgesic properties since it exerted a significant and dose-dependent effect on the chemical (acetic acid-induced) and thermic (heat) painful stimuli from the respective doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg<sup>22</sup>.

Many natural plant extracts have been investigated with respect to the suppression of glucose production from carbohydrates in the gut or glucose absorption from the intestine.

$\alpha$ - amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of  $\alpha$  -1,4-glucosidic linkages of starch, glycogen and various

oligosaccharides and  $\alpha$ -glucosidase further breaks down the disaccharides into simpler sugars, readily available for the intestinal absorption. The inhibition of their activity, in the digestive tract of humans, is considered to be effective to control diabetes by diminishing the absorption of glucose decomposed from starch by these enzymes. Therefore, effective and nontoxic inhibitors of  $\alpha$  - amylase and  $\alpha$ -glucosidase have long been sought, and for the first time, studies have revealed the anti-diabetic potential of *T. decandra* and these studies could be helpful to develop medicinal preparations for diabetes<sup>22</sup>.

The probable mechanism by which *T. portulacastrum* exerts its hepatoprotective action against paracetamol or thioacetamide-induced hepatocellular metabolic alterations could be by the stimulation of hepatic regeneration through an improved synthesis of protein or accelerated detoxification and excretion<sup>22</sup>.

#### **Anti-inflammatory activity**

The anti-inflammatory activity of methanolic and organic extracts of the following plants: *T. portulacastrum*, *Aizoon canariense*, *Aizoon hispanicum*,

Structures of isolated metabolites from family Aizozaceae

{21}------------------------------------------------

*T. decandra* and *Sceletium spp.* was evaluated against formaldehyde-induced arthritis in rats, and a significant inhibition of chemically-induced arthritis, indicates anti-inflammatory potential<sup>17-22-24-51</sup>.

Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in acute and chronic models. Significant anti-inflammatory activity was observed for chloroform extract of *T. decandra* in both carrageenan, dextran, and mediators induced edema models. The chloroform extract showed maximum inhibition of 58.36% at the dose of 200 mg/kg after 3 hrs of drug treatment in carrageenan-induced paw edema. The chloroform extract of *T. decandra* also exhibited significant anti-inflammatory properties in dextran-induced paw edema model. Dextran-induced paw edema is known to be mediated both by histamine and serotonin. Dextran induces fluid accumulation, which contains little protein and few neutrophils, whereas carrageenan induces protein rich exudation containing large number of neutrophils. The extract effectively suppressed the inflammation produced by both carrageenan and dextran<sup>22</sup>.

#### Antimicrobial activity

It has been reported that the methanolic extract of *M. nodiflorum*, *M. crystallinum*, *M. forsskaolii*, and *Aizon canariense* showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activity against: *Bacillus subtilis*, *K. pneumonia*, *S. aureus*, *S. pyogenes*, *E. coli*, *A. fumigatus*, *A. nigar*, *C. albicans*, and *Mucor spp.*<sup>48</sup>. For *C. edulis* five bioactive flavonoid compounds, rutin, neoheesperidin, hyperoside, cactichin, and ferulic acid were isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction and individually or collectively were responsible for the antibacterial against 11 known human pathogenic bacteria, five Gram-positive: *Staphylococcus epidermidis*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Bacillus subtilis*, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Streptococcus pyogenes*, and six Gram-negative: *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Acinetobacter baumanii*, *Moraxella catarrhalis*<sup>34</sup>. Moreover, the isolated compounds from the ethanolic extract of *Galenia Africana* showed a remarkable antimycobacterial activity against *M. smegmatis* and *M. tuberculosis*<sup>55</sup>.

The extracts and the essential oil from the fresh leaves of *S. portulacastrum* showed antibacterial, antifungal. The ethanolic extract showed potential antibacterial activity against the causative agents and pathogens related to various gastrointestinal disorders leading to indigestion, dysentery, and diarrhea<sup>15</sup>. Moreover, the ethanolic extract of the *S. portulacastrum* showed potential against the causative agents of nosocomial infections, *Staphylococcus aureus* and *E. coli*, while the essential oil exhibited notable antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and

Gram-negative bacteria as well as significant antifungal<sup>15</sup>. In addition, *S. portulacastrum*, showed positive activity against human immunodeficiency viruses<sup>15</sup>. Finally, it was reported that the new isolated flavonoid 2 - (3', 4' dihydroxy-phenyl) - 3, 5, 7-trihydroxy-chromen-4-one isolated from *T. decandra* showed antibacterial activity against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and by molecular docking it was found that FAS II  $\beta$ -hydroxyacyl-ACP (*FabZ*) of *P. aeruginosa* is a potential target of the isolated compound<sup>40</sup>. There are many other reported biological activities of members of family Aizoaceae as shown in **Table 11**.

## CONCLUSIONS

From this review, it can be deduced that the major compounds of family Aizoaceae are alkaloids, triterpenes, flavonoids, sterols, lignans, fatty acids, phenolic acids, and essential oils. The review also showed that different extracts of aerial parts of plants of family Aizoaceae posse diverse biological activities such as anti-acetylcholinesterase, anti-butyrylcholinesterase, anti-infective, anti-hyperlipidemic, antipyretic, antifertility, diuretic, nephroprotective and others. It would, therefore, be important to extensively investigate their phytochemicals and pharmacologically determine their activities for future drug discovery and development.
