    The Botanical and Chemical Distribution
    <br/>
    of Hallucinogens*
   </h1>
   <p>
    RICHARD EVANS SCHULTES, PH.D.**
   </p>
   <p>
    Out of the vast array of species in the plant kingdom—variously estimated at from 200,000 to 800,000—a few have been employed in primitive societies for millennia to induce visual, auditory, tactile, and other hallucinations. Because of their earthly effects that often defy description, they have usually been considered sacred and have played central roles as sacraments in aboriginal religions (Schultes 1969a).
   </p>
   <p>
    Scientific interest in hallucinogenic agents has recently been intense, partly because of the hope of finding potentially valuable drugs for use in experimental or even therapeutic psychiatry and also for use as possible tools in an explanation of the biochemical origins of mental abnormalities (Hoffer &amp; Osmond 1967).
   </p>
   <p>
    While psychoactive species are widely scattered throughout the plant world, they appear to be concentrated more or less amongst the fungi and angiosperms. The bacteria, algae, lichens, bryophytes, ferns, and gymnosperms seem to be notably poor or lacking in species with hallucinogenic properties (Schultes 1969-1970). These hallucinogenic properties can be ascribed, likewise, to only a few kinds of organic constituents, which may be conveniently divided into two broad groups: nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous compounds (Der Marderosian 1967a; Farnsworth 1968 &amp; 1969; Hofmann 1961a &amp; 1968; Taylor 1966; Usdin &amp; Efron 1967). See Figure 1 for basic chemical skeletons.
   </p>
   <p>
    The nitrogenous compounds play by far the greater role and comprise, for the most part, alkaloids or related
   </p>
   <p>
    substances, the majority of which are, or may be classified into the following groups: 1.
    <math>
     \beta
    </math>
    -carbolines; 2. ergolines; 3. indoles; 4. isoquinolines; 5. isoxazoles; 6.
    <math>
     \beta
    </math>
    -phenylethylamines; 7. quinolizidines; 8. tropanes; 9. tryptamines. Non-nitrogenous compounds which are the active principles in at least two well-known hallucinogens include: 1. dibenzopyrans; and 2. phenylpropenes; other compounds, such as catechols and alcohols, may occasionally play a role.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the study of hallucinogenic plants, two considerations must be borne in mind. One consideration reminds us that there are some of these psychoactive plants used in primitive societies for which the active chemical principles are as yet not known. The other emphasizes that man undoubtedly has utilized only a few of the species that actually do possess hallucinogenic principles: we are, as yet, far from knowing how many plants are endowed with psychotomimetic constituents, but there are certainly many more than the few employed by man as hallucinogens (Schultes 1967).
   </p>
   <p>
    While almost all hallucinogenic compounds are of vegetal origin, a few may be wholly or partly synthetic. The potent hallucinogen, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), although very closely allied chemically to the naturally occurring ergolines, has not been found in the plant kingdom.

    often allocated, together with the hops plant (
    <i>
     Humulus
    </i>
    ), in a separate family,
    <i>
     Cannabaceae
    </i>
    , represents perhaps one of the oldest and certainly the world's most widespread hallucinogen. The source also of hempen fibres and of an edible seed-oil, the plant is native probably to central Asia but is now found cultivated or spontaneous in most parts of the world. It is represented by many agricultural varieties and ecological races or strains, some of which are rich, some poor, some even lacking in the intoxicating principles.
   </p>
   <p>
    The biodynamic activity of
    <i>
     Cannabis
    </i>
    is due to a number of constituents contained in a red oil distilled from the resin, mainly to a mixture of stereoisomers collectively called tetrahydrocannabinols and sundry related compounds, including cannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabidiolic acid, cannabigerol, and tetrahydrocannabinolcarboxylic acid (Hofmann 1968; Korte &amp; Sieper 1965; Schulz 1964). The compound
    <math>
     \Delta^1
    </math>
    -tetrahydrocannabinol has recently been shown to be the principal biologically active constituent of
    <i>
     Cannabis
    </i>
    (Mechoulam et al. 1967; Mechoulam &amp; Gaoni 1965). Cannabichrome has likewise been reported as active. Cannabinol and cannabidiol are devoid of euphoric properties, although cannabidiol, when heated with an acidic catalyst, may be converted into an active mixture of tetrahydrocannabinols, a conversion that may be effected during the smoking of
    <i>
     Cannabis
    </i>
    . Cannabigerol and cannabidiolic acid are sedative, and the latter compound has antimicrobial properties (Farnsworth 1968; Hofmann 1968). Cannabinol and the tetrahydrocannabinols have been synthesized. The first biologically active principle to have been structurally elucidated and synthesized was

     \Delta^1
    </math>
    -2,3-
    <i>
     trans
    </i>
    tetrahydrocannabinol (Hofmann 1968).
   </p>
   <p>
    The widely recognized and extreme variation in psychoactive effects of
    <i>
     Cannabis
    </i>
    is due possibly to the instability of some of the constituents which, upon aging or maturation of the plant, may be converted from active to inactive compounds or vice versa. It is believed that some of these conversions take place more readily and rapidly in the drier tropics than in temperate climates. Many phytobiotic factors seem to have effects on the chemical composition of the resin.
   </p>
   <p>
    This variability and the absence of controlled experiments — almost all experimentation has been done with crude plant material of unknown chemical constitution — have led to a disturbing lack of uniformity of opinion on the physiological effects of
    <i>
     Cannabis
    </i>
    , a situation that has seriously handicapped social and legal control of the use or abuse of the drug (Weil 1969b).

     Myristica

    . — The tree that yields the spices nutmeg and mace —
    <i>
     Myristica fragrans
    </i>
    — is thought to have been employed aboriginally as a narcotic in southeastern Asia, where it is native. It is sometimes used as an hallucinogen in sophisticated circles in Europe and North America and has occasionally become a problem in prisons in the United States (Weil 1965, 1967 &amp; 1969a).
   </p>
   <p>
    Although its toxicology has not yet been wholly elucidated, the psychoactive principles are contained probably in the essential oil of the seed and aril. The composition of nutmeg oil is highly variable, both qualitatively and quantitatively, but it does contain fatty acids, terpenes, and aromatics. The psychopharmacological effects may be attributable to several phenylpropenes. Elemicine, myristicine, and safrol have been suggested as the active constituents of the oil, which may also contain eugenol, isoeugenol, methylisoeugenol, methyleugenol, and isoelemicine. It seems doubtful that myristicine or safrol are responsible for a significant part of the hallucinogenic effects. While these properties may be attributable largely to elemicine, no studies on the psychopharmacological activity of pure elemicine or safrol have as yet been made (Shulgin 1967; Truitt 1967).
   </p>
   <p>
    For hallucinating purposes, ground nutmeg is taken orally in large doses, usually several teaspoonfuls. The effects vary appreciably but are often characterized by distortion of perception of time and space, dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth, headache, and occasionally visual hallucinations (Weil 1967).

    <i>

    , native of the Moluccas and source of two products: nutmeg from its seed and mace from the aril surrounding the seed.

    as an intoxicant. The leaves, gathered usually in October, are toasted and made into a tea, sometimes with stems, flowering tops, and the white flowers. Honey or sugar is added to lessen the bitterness (Bunge 1847).
   </p>
   <p>
    In 1945, a crystalline material called lagochiline, at first thought to be an alkaloid, was isolated. More recent studies, however, have indicated that it is a polyhydric alcohol and that it occurs in concentrations of up to 3%

    A genus of some 100 species of tropical America,
    <i>
     Banisteriopsis

    is taxonomically still rather poorly understood. This is true especially of
    <i>
     B. Caapi
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     B. inebrians
    </i>
    , partly because of the lack of fertile material for study of these infrequently flowering jungle lianas, even though the first botanical attention to this drug plant dates from 1854, when it was first encountered in northwestern Brazil by the explorer Spruce (Schultes 1968).
   </p>
   <p>
    The chemistry of these hallucinogenic species of
    <i>
     Banisteriopsis
    </i>
    has been more critically investigated than
   </p>
   <p>
    the taxonomy, yet failure of chemists to insist upon botanically determined material for analyses has created chaos. Earlier workers isolated alkaloidal constituents from plants probably referable to
    <i>
     B. Caapi
    </i>
    which they named telepathine, yageine, banisterine, all of which were eventually identified as harmine (Henry 1949). More recent examination of botanically authenticated material of this species has established the presence in the bark — and sometimes in the leaves — of harmine as well as occasional lesser amounts of harmaline and
    <math>
     \Delta
    </math>
    -tetrahydroharmine (Chen &amp; Chen 1939; Deulofeu 1967). Recent investigations of
    <i>
     B. inebrians
    </i>
    have isolated harmine from the stems and minute amounts of what appears to be harmaline (O'Connell &amp; Lynn 1953). An interesting chemical study of stems of the type collection of
    <i>
     B. Caapi
    </i>
    has indicated, in spite of passage of some 115 years, the presence of harmine in concentrations matching that of freshly collected material (Schultes et al 1969).
   </p>
   <p>
    While
    <i>
     Banisteriopsis Caapi
    </i>
    is normally employed as a drink, recent indirect evidence from the northwest Amazon indicates that it may also be used as a snuff. Harmala alkaloids have been reported from snuff powders prepared from a vine said also to be the source of an intoxicating drink, but voucher botanical specimens are lacking (Holmstedt &amp; Lindgren 1967).
   </p>
   <p>
    Harmine has been isolated from

    . — The early Spanish chroniclers of Mexico reported that the Indians employed in their religious and magic rites an hallucinogenic seed called
    <i>
     ololiuqui
    </i>
    by the Aztecs. It was also used medicinally, and when applied as a poultice was said to have analgesic properties.
   </p>
   <p>
    Known as
    <i>
     coatl-xoxoubigui
    </i>
    ("snake plant"), it was adequately illustrated as a morning glory. Although several Mexican botanists accepted this identification during the last century, not until 30 years ago was a voucher specimen of a convolvulaceous plant, the seeds of which were employed as a divinatory hallucinogen, collected amongst the Mazatecs of Oaxaca and determined as
    <i>
     Rivea corymbosa
    </i>
    . Later field work uncovered similar uses of another morning glory,
    <i>
     Ipomoea violacea
    </i>
    amongst the Zapotecs, also of Oaxaca; this species represents possibly the narcotic
    <i>

    of the ancient Aztecs (MacDougall 1960; Schultes 1941; Wasson 1962).

    In the interval, ololiqui had been identified as a species of
    <i>
     Datura
    </i>
    , an identification that gained wide acceptance (Safford 1916b). The reasoning upon which this theory was based held that in four centuries no narcotic used had been observed for a morning glory; the convolvulaceous flowers resembled those of a
    <i>
     Datura
    </i>
    and might have led to confusion; descriptions of ololiqui-intoxication coincided closely with that induced by

    ;
    <i>
     Datura

    had been and still is employed as a divinatory narcotic in Mexico; and, most significantly, no psychoactive principle was known from the

   <p>
    Experimental psychiatry indicated that
    <i>
     Rivea
    </i>
    was definitely hallucinogenic, supporting ethnobotanical field work (Osmond 1955). Yet chemists were unable to isolate any inebriating constituents until 1960 and subsequently, when ergot alkaloids related to the synthetic hallucinogenic compound LSD were found in the seeds of both
    <i>
     R. corymbosa
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     I. violacea
    </i>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    The main psychotomimetic constituent of the seeds of both species are ergine(

    -lysergic acid diethylamide) and isoergine(
    <math>
     d\Delta
    </math>
    -isolysergic acid diethylamide) which occur together with minor alkaloids: chanoclavine, elymoclavine, and lysergol. Ergometrine appears to be present in seeds of
    <i>
     I. violacea
    </i>
    but absent in
    <i>
     R. corymbosa
    </i>
    . The total alkaloid content of
    <i>
     R. corymbosa
    </i>
    seed is 0.012%; of
    <i>
     I. violacea
    </i>
    , 0.06% — and, indeed, Indians use smaller quantities of the latter than of the former (Hofmann 1961a, 1961b, 1963a, 1963b, 1964, 1966, 1967, 1968; Hofmann &amp; Cerletti 1961).

    The discovery of ergot alkaloids — constituents of
    <i>
     Claviceps purpurea
    </i>
    , a relatively primitive fungus — in one of the phylogenetically most advanced angiosperm families was unexpected and is of great chemotaxonomic interest. Suspicion that fungal spores might have contaminated the convolvulaceous seeds was ruled out experimentally (Taber &amp; Heacock 1962); and the discovery of these alkaloids in fresh leaves, stalks, and roots of
    <i>
     I. violacea
    </i>
    and, to a minor extent, in leaves of
    <i>
     R. corymbosa
    </i>
    indicated that these constituents are produced by the tissue of the morning glories themselves, not by infecting fungi (Taber et al 1963a).
   </p>
   <p>
    Large amounts of a new glycoside, turbicoryn, were likewise isolated from seeds of
    <i>
     R. corymbosa
    </i>
    , but this compound apparently has no part in the psychotomimetic action (Cook &amp; Keeland 1962; Pérezamador &amp; Herrán 1960).
   </p>
   <p>
    Studies have shown the presence of these ergot alkaloids in a number of horticultural "varieties" of
    <i>
     I. violacea

    and other species of

    . This narcotic is of great social importance, especially in Gabon and nearby portions of the Congo in Africa. The use of
    <i>
     iboga
    </i>
    , first reported by French and Belgian explorers in the middle of the last century, appears to be spreading. In Gabon, it is employed in initiation rites of secret societies, the most famous of which is the Bwiti cult. Sorcerers take the drug before communicating with the spirit world or seeking advice from ancestors (Pope 1969).
   </p>
   <p>
    Twelve closely related indole alkaloids have been reported from
    <i>
     iboga
    </i>
    ; they comprise up to 6% of the dried material. Ibogaine, apparently the principal psychoactive alkaloid, acts as a cholinesterase inhibitor, a strong central stimulant, and as an hallucinogen (Hoffer &amp; Osmond 1967; Pope 1969).

    The Aryan invaders of India 3500 years ago worshipped a plant, the god-narcotic
    <i>
     soma
    </i>
    , center of an elaborate cult in which the inebriating juice was ceremonially drunk (Wasson 1969). More than 1000 hymns to
    <i>
     soma
    </i>
    have survived in the Rig Veda, describing the plant and its significance in detail. The use of
    <i>
     soma
    </i>
    died out 2000 years ago. Botanists have proposed more than 100 species in attempts to identify
    <i>
     soma
    </i>
    , but none have been satisfactory. The most recent identification of
    <i>
     soma
    </i>
    as
    <i>
     Amanita muscaria
    </i>
    appears, from the indirect evidence at hand, to be highly probable.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the 18th Century, Europeans discovered the narcotic use of
    <i>
     Amanita muscaria
    </i>
    among the primitive tribesmen of Siberia. Until very recently it was employed as an orgiastic or shamanistic inebriate by the Ostyak and Vogul, Finno-Ugrian peoples in western Siberia, and the Chukchi, Koryak and Kamchadal of northeastern Siberia. Tradition has established its use among other peoples (Brekman 1967; Lewin 1964; Wasson 1967 &amp; 1969).
   </p>
   <p>
    In Siberia, several mushrooms sufficed to induce
   </p>
   <p>
    intoxication — taken as extracts in water or milk, alone or with the juice of
    <i>
     Vaccinium uliginosum
    </i>
    or
    <i>
     Epilobium angustifolium
    </i>
    . A dried mushroom may be held moistened in the mouth, or women may chew them and roll them into pellets for the men to ingest. Since the mushrooms often are expensive, the Siberians practiced ritualistic drinking of the urine of an intoxicated person, having discovered that the inebriating principles were excreted unaltered by the kidneys. Urine-drinking is mentioned also in the Rig Veda hymns to
    <i>
     soma
    </i>
    (Wasson 1969).
   </p>
   <p>
    Since the discovery in 1869 of muscarine, the intoxicating activity of
    <i>
     Amanita muscaria
    </i>
    has been attributed to this alkaloid. Recent studies, however, have indicated that muscarine represents a minor constituent of the mushroom to which the strong inebriation could hardly be attributed. Trace amounts of bufotenine in the carpophores, likewise, could not be responsible, if indeed it be present. The reported presence of tropane alkaloids has been shown to be due to incorrect interpretation of chromatographic data. Other compounds detected in
    <i>
     A. muscaria
    </i>
    are choline, acetylcholine, and muscaridine (Waser 1967).
   </p>
   <p>
    Recent chemical and pharmacological studies have shown that the principal biologically active constituents appear to be muscimole, the enolbetaine of 5-amino-ethyl-3-hydroxy-isoxazole — an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid which is excreted in the urine; and ibotenic acid, the zwitterion of
    <math>
     \alpha
    </math>
    -amino-
    <math>
     \alpha
    </math>
    -[3-hydroxy-isoxazoyl-5]-acid monohydrate. The less active musoazone, likewise an amino acid,
    <math>
     \alpha
    </math>
    -amino-
    <math>
     \alpha
    </math>
    [2(3H)-oxazolonyl-(5)]-acetic acid, is present in varying but lesser amounts. Structurally related to these isoxazoles is the antibiotic oxamycine which often has psychoactive effects — mental confusion, psychotic depression, abnormal behavior — in man. Other active substances structurally still not elucidated are also known to be present (Eugster 1967; Waser 1967; Wieland 1968).
   </p>
   <p>
    The widely recognized variability in psychoactivity of
    <i>
     A. muscaria
    </i>
    results probably from varying ratios of ibotenic acid and muscimole in the carpophores. In spite of appreciable variability between individuals and at different times, certain effects are characteristic: twitching of the limbs, a period of good humor and euphoria, macroscopia, occasionally colored visions of the supernatural and illusions of grandeur. Religious overtones frequently occur, and the partaker may become violent, dashing madly about, until exhaustion and deep sleep overtake him.

It was first fully described by the early Spanish medical doctor Francisco Hernández, but many other colonial Spanish chroniclers detailed the strange story of peyote. Peyote rites persist in several tribes of northern Mexico. It was used in Texas in 1760, was known among American Indians during the Civil War, but came to public attention in the United States about 1880, when the Kiowas and Comanches elaborated a typical Plains Indian vision-quest ritual around its ceremonial ingestion. The peyote cult, organized as the Native American Church, has gradually spread to many tribes in the United States and Canada and counts 250,000 adherents (La Barre 1960 &amp; 1964; Schultes 1937a, pp. 61-88, 129-152; 1937b; 1970). The chlorophyll-bearing crown of the cactus, dried into discoidal "mescal buttons" which are virtually indestructible and can be shipped long distances, is eaten.

    The peyote cactus was first botanically described as
    <i>
     Echinocactus Williamsii
    </i>
    in 1845. It has frequently been referred to this genus and to
    <i>
     Anbalonium
    </i>
    in the chemical literature. In 1894, it was placed in the monotypic genus
    <i>
     Lophophora
    </i>
    . Its nomenclature and taxonomy are still confused, and
    <i>
     L. Williamsii

The phenylethylamine mescaline is exclusively responsible for the visual hallucinations; its derivatives, N-methylmescaline and N-acetylmescaline, are apparently not active. Hordenine, another phenylethylamine, is also present in peyote. Peyonine, a novel

Mexican and Texan Indians formerly employed these beans in the ceremonial Red Bean Dance as an oracular and divinatory medium and for visions in initiation rites (La Barre 1964; Schultes 1937a, 4: 129-152). Its use died out in the United States with the arrival of peyote, a much safer hallucinogen. Mescal beans, which contain cystisine, are capable of causing death by asphyxiation (Henry 1949; Howard 1957). Historical reports of the mescal bean go back to 1539, but archaeological remains suggest their ritualistic use earlier than 100 A.D. (Campbell 1958).

There are six or seven species of this subgenus, although a recent proposal treats them as comprising three species and a number of cultivars (Schultes 1961; 1963a; 1963b; 1965; 1969b).

    Some species were of the greatest social and religious importance in ancient Andean cultures. The Chibchas of Colombia, for example, administered potions of

   <p>
    The preparation and use of
    <i>
     Datura
    </i>
    differ widely in South America today, but many tribes still employ it for prophecy, divination, and other magico-religious purposes for which the visions are important. The Kamsá of southern Colombia, for example, use several species and numerous named clones, vegetatively propagated and so highly atrophied that they may represent incipient varieties. These monstrous "races" differ, according to witch doctors, in narcotic strength and are, consequently, used for different purposes (Bristol 1966; 1969).

   <p>
    What may possibly represent an extreme variant of an indeterminate species of tree-
    <i>
     Datura

    <i>
     Methysticodendron Amesianum

   <p>
    Chemical work on many of the species of
    <i>
     Datura
    </i>
    has long been carried out, but there is still appreciable variation in results due primarily to failure to insist on authentically vouchered identification of the material analyzed. The principal alkaloids, all tropanes, are hyoscyamine, norhyoscyamine, and scopolamine, present in most of the species; the inactive meteloidine, present in
    <i>
     D. meteloides
    </i>
    ; and cusohygrine, found in the roots of several species. It does not contain a tropane ring but biogenetically may be related to the other

    </i>
    -alkaloids (Henry 1949; Leete 1959; Willaman 1961). There are differences in total alkaloid content and in percentage of scopolamine, according to area of cultivation. In Andean plants of
    <i>
     Datura candida

    scopolamine constitutes from 50-60% of the total base content, as contrasted to 30-34% for the same plants grown in England and Hawaii. Aerial portions of typical

    <i>
     Methysticodendron
    </i>
    contained scopolamine up to 80% of the total alkaloid content (Pachter &amp; Hopkinson 1960).

    Significantly, the alkaloidal content in the cultivars of

    <i>
     teonanacatl
    </i>
    ("food of the gods") (Heim &amp; Wasson 1959; Safford 1915).
   </p>
   <p>
    European persecution drove the cult into hiding in the hinterlands. Notwithstanding the many descriptions in the writings of the early chroniclers, no evidence that the narcotic use of mushrooms had persisted was uncovered until about 30 years ago. Botanists had even postulated that
    <i>
     teonanacatl
    </i>
    was the same plant as
    <i>
     peyote
    </i>
    : that the discoidal crown of the cactus, when dried, superficially resembled a dried mushroom and that the earlier writers had confused the two or had been deliberately duped by their Aztec informants. Then, during the 1930s, several investigators found an active mushroom cult amongst the Mazatecs in Oaxaca and collected, as the hallucinogenic fungi,
    <i>
     Panaeolus sphinctrinus
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Stropharia cubensis
    </i>
    . Later and more intensive work during the 1950s brought to over 24 species in at least four genera the number of basidiomycetes employed currently in six or more tribes of Mexican Indians (Guzman 1959; Heim 1956, pp. 965-68, 1389-95; 1957a; 1957b; 1963; 1966; Heim et al 1967; Schultes 1939; 1940; Singer 1958; Wasson 1957; 1958; 1959; 1963).
   </p>
   <p>
    It now appears that the mushroom cults are of great age and were once much more widespread. Archeological artifacts, now called "mushroom stones," excavated in great numbers from highland Mayan sites in Guatemala, are dated conservatively at 1000 B.C. Consisting of a stem with a human or animal face and crowned with an umbrella-like top, these icons indicate the existence of a sophisticated mushroom cult at least 3000 years ago.
   </p>

    Perhaps the most important species employed in Mexican mushroom rites are
    <i>

    , and
    <i>
     Stropharia cubensis
    </i>
    (Heim et al 1967; Heim &amp; Wasson 1959). All of these have been found to contain a most extraordinarily psychoactive compound, psilocybine — an hydroxy-indole alkylamine with a phosphorylated side chain: 4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine — and sometimes the unstable derivative, psilocine: 4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine.

    indole compound with a phosphoric acid radical known from the plant kingdom, and both psilocybine and psilocine are novel indoles in having the hydroxy radical substituted in the 4-position. Tryptophan is probably the biogenetic precursor of psilocybine (Hofmann et al 1958a; 1958b; 1959; Hofmann &amp; Troxler 1959; Hofmann &amp; Tscherter 1960).

In Colombia, only witch doctors employ it, but in Brazil the intoxicant is taken by all adult males, either individually at any time or ritually in excess at endocannibalistic ceremonies amongst the Waikás. The resin, which is boiled, dried, pulverized, and occasionally mixed with powdered leaves of a

    or "leaf of god" and believing them to clarify the senses (MacDougall 1968). Although the plant has long been used in folk medicine, few reliable chemical studies appear to have been carried out (Schultes 1969a). Preliminary investigations have indicated the presence of a possible new alkaloid (Holmstedt, personal communication).
