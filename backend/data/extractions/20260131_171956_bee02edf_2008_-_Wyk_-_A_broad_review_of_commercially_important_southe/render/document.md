## ABSTRACT

**Aims of the study:** Commercially important indigenous medicinal plants of southern Africa are reviewed in the context of fundamental knowledge about their ethnobotany, phylogeny, genetics, taxonomy, biochemistry, chemical variation, reproductive biology and horticulture. The aim is to explore the rapidly increasing number of scientific publications and to investigate the need for further research.

**Materials and methods:** The Scopus (Elsevier) reference system was used to investigate trends in the number of scientific publications and patents in 38 medicinal plant species. Fifteen species of special commercial interest were chosen for more detailed reviews: *Agathosma betulina*, *Aloe ferox*, *Artemisia afra*, *Aspalathus linearis*, *Cyclopia genistoides*, *Harpagophytum procumbens*, *Hoodia gordonii*, *Hypoxis hemerocallidea*, *Lippia javanica*, *Mesembryanthemum tortuosum*, *Pelargonium sidoides*, *Siphonochilus aethiopicus*, *Sutherlandia frutescens*, *Warburgia salutaris* and *Xysmalobium undulatum*.

**Results:** In recent years there has been an upsurge in research and development of new medicinal products and new medicinal crops, as is shown by a rapid increase in the number of scientific publications and patents. Despite the fact that an estimated 10% of the plant species of the world is found in southern Africa, only a few have been fully commercialized and basic scientific information is often not available.

**Conclusions:** The limited available information indicates that some of the plants display remarkable regional variation in morphological, genetic and chemical characters that should be more thoroughly investigated. Basic biological information is needed to guide the rapidly accelerating commercialization process, especially the selection of superior clones, the development of new cultivars and the standardization of raw materials.

## 1. Introduction

Africa, and especially southern Africa, has a rich diversity of plants. Recent statistics show that about 25% of the total number of higher plants in the world is found in Africa south of the Sahara. According to the "African Plant Checklist and Database Project" ([Klopper e](#block-11-0)t [al., 2](#block-11-0)006), a total of 50,136 angiosperm taxa occur in tropical Africa and southern Africa. This figure is based on a recent merging of two major data bases—EPFAT (Énumération des plantes à fleurs d'Afrique) and FSA (Flora of southern Africa). The combined checklist shows a total of 32,424 taxa in tropical Africa and 22,755 taxa in southern Africa. A useful reference book on the medicinal plants of the whole of the African continent ([Neuwinger, 2](#block-11-0)000) lists more than 5400 medicinal plant taxa and over 16,300 medicinal uses. It is generally accepted (e.g. [Geldenhuys a](#block-10-0)nd [Van W](#block-10-0)yk, [2002\)](#block-10-0) that natural resources will play a major role in the socio-economic development of the African continent. The angiosperm species count for southern Africa ([Germishuizen a](#block-10-0)nd [Meyer, 2](#block-10-0)003) is 21,817 and the count for the Cape Floristic Region (Goldblatt [and M](#block-10-0)anning, 2001) is 8888. [Van W](#block-12-0)yk [and G](#block-12-0)ericke [\(\[2000\\)\]\(#block-11-0\) e](#block-12-0)stimated that about 3000 medicinal plants are regularly used in southern Africa. An annotated checklist of traditional medicinal plants of southern Africa ([Arnold \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-10-0\)002\)](#block-10-0) gives a total of 3481 plant taxa, of which 2942 are administered to people only. Basic information about the most widely used species can be found in [Van](#block-12-0) [Wyk \[e\]\(#block-10-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l. \[\\(\]\(#block-12-0\)1997\),](#block-12-0) [Van \[W\]\(#block-12-0\)yk \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)nd \[G\]\(#block-12-0\)ericke \[\\(\]\(#block-12-0\)2000\) a](#block-12-0)nd [Diederichs](#block-10-0) [\(2006\). T](#block-10-0)his diversity represents a very valuable resource, not only for commercial development but also for basic scientific study.

This paper is aimed at reviewing southern African medicinal plants that are currently of particular interest in new product development. Basic researches relating to 15 commercially highly relevant species in South Africa are briefly reviewed. The aim is to show the potential value and application of fundamental knowledge, to explore the rapidly accelerating numbers of scientific publications and to highlight the need for further biosystematic research on southern African plants.

## 2. Commercialized indigenous plant species

Of the estimated 3000 medicinal plant species that are regularly used in traditional medicine in South Africa, only about 38 indigenous species have been commercialized to some extent (i.e. they are available as processed materials in modern packaging and in various dosage forms as teas, tinctures, tabl[et](#block-10-0)s, capsules or ointments). Several others are also produced for multi-million Rand informal markets ([Cunningham, 1](#block-10-0)988; [Mander, 1](#block-10-0)998; [Williams e](#block-10-0)t [al., 2](#block-10-0)000). A useful review of various aspects of the commercialization process in South Africa is given by [Diederichs \(](#block-10-0)2006). The major commercialized species are listed in [Table 1,](#block-2-0) together with basic ethnobotanical information and some key references. The list includes indigenous species that are widely distributed in Africa and that have been extensively commercialized in other parts of Africa and/or in other parts of the world (e.g. *Adansonia digitata*, *Centella asiatica*, *Kigelia africana*, *Prunus africana* and *Trichilia emetica*). Also included are two famous and popular herbs of Ayurvedic medicine that have hitherto been of limited commercial interest in South Africa (*Centella asiatica* and *Withania somnifera*). Wild-harvested material of *Merwilla plumbea* (Lindl.) Sp[eta](#block-12-0) (syn. *Scilla natalensis* Planch.), *Bowiea volubilis* Harv. ex Hook.f. and several

other important medicinal plant species is traded in large volumes on local markets but have as yet only been formally commercialized to a limited extent. Several of the plants listed in [Table 1 a](#block-2-0)re endemic to southern Africa and some of them are treated in d[eta](#block-11-0)iled reviews in this volume.

In order to gain some insight into the scientific and/or commercial interest in South African medicinal plants, a literature search was conducted with the well-known Scopus literature reference system maintained by Elsevier. Using the scientific names of the species and the "quick search" option, varying numbers of "hits" were obtained for those species listed in [Table 1. T](#block-2-0)he searches were carefully executed to include main synonyms and other commercial species of the same genus where relevant (e.g. *Cyclopia*). The results are summarized in [Table 2, w](#block-3-0)hich outlines the number of scientific publications and the number of citation in patents in recent years. The general trend is one of an increasing number of papers and citations since 1995, although this is not true for all the species. The popularity of *Centella asiatica* and *Withania somnifera* in Ayurvedic medicine is reflected in the large number of citations and publications over many years. Relatively large numbers are also seen for those species that are well established in tropical Africa as important medicinal plants (e.g. *Adansonia digitata*, *Kigelia africana* and *Prunus africana*). These species have been of limited commercial interest in South Africa despite their popularity elsewhere.

[Table 2](#block-3-0) reveals a rapid increase in the number of publications and patent citations for several indigenous species that were scientifically practically unknown and unstudied prior to 1995. Raw material of some species has only become available in commercial quantities in recent years, so that the number of ethnopharmacological studies has sharply increased since 1995. This trend was discussed by [Light e](#block-11-0)t [al. \(](#block-11-0)2005, [and r](#block-11-0)eferences [cited t](#block-11-0)herein) and is also reflected in review papers in this volume. In several cases, the number of scientific papers published since 2006 (i.e., a period of just over 2 years) already exceed those published in the preceding 5-year periods of 1995–2000 and 2001–2005. Notable examples are *Cyclopia genistoides*, *Euclea natalensis*, *Hoodia gordonii*, *Hypoxis hemerocallidea*, *Pelargonium sidoides* and *Sutherlandia frutescens*. Rapid recent increases in the number of patent citations are also evident, especially for *Adansonia*, *Aspalathus*, *Cyclopia*, *Harpagophytum*, *Hoodia*, *Mesembryanthemum*, *Pelargonium* and *Sutherlandia*. Well-known commercialized species such as *Harpagophytum procumbens* and *Aloe ferox* has been the subject of scientific investigation over many years. The decreasing trend in *Mesembryanthemum tortuosum* is due an early interest in the unique alkaloids of these plants and a rather slow pace of commercialization. Recent research and development activity is also reflected in the data for some well-established commercial species, including *Aspalathus linearis* and *Xysmalobium undulatum* (both of which were first commercialized more than 100 years ago).

## 3. Biosystematic and chemotaxonomic studies

A summary of published information on a selection of 15 commercially relevant medicinal plants of South Africa (see [Fig. 1 a](#block-4-0)nd [Tables 1 and 2\)](#block-2-0) is given below. General information about these plants can be obtained from [Watt a](#block-13-0)nd [Breyer-Brandwijk \(](#block-13-0)1962), [Hutchings e](#block-10-0)t [al. \(](#block-10-0)1996), [Van W](#block-12-0)yk [et a](#block-10-0)l. [\(1997\), V](#block-12-0)an [Wyk a](#block-12-0)nd [Gericke](#block-12-0) [\(2000\) a](#block-12-0)nd [Van W](#block-12-0)yk [and W](#block-12-0)ink [\(2004\). E](#block-12-0)ach of the species is briefly discussed, with emphasis on what is known about their ethnobotanical

### 3.1. *Agathosma betulina* (P.J. Bergius) Pillans (Rutaceae)—round leaf buchu

Buchu is an important plant in the Khoi-San tradition ([Van W](#block-12-0)yk [and G](#block-12-0)ericke, [2000\)](#block-12-0) and still enjoys a great reputation as a gen-

eral health tonic, diuretic and mild urinary antiseptic. The essential oil is a valuable flavour product (similar to *cassis*) and is probably responsible for the antispasmodic, antiseptic and diuretic activities ([Wichtl a](#block-13-0)nd [Bisset, 2](#block-13-0)000; [Lis-Balchin e](#block-13-0)t [al., 2](#block-13-0)001). Isomenthone and diosphenol are the major volatile compounds ([Kaiser \[e\]\(#block-13-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-11-0\)975;](#block-11-0) [Posthumus \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-11-0\)996\).](#block-11-0)

Buchu is a resprouting shrub endemic to the Cape. Revisions by [Pillans \(](#block-12-0)1950) and [Spreeth \(](#block-12-0)1976) clarified th[e ta](#block-11-0)xonomy of *Agath-*

{5}------------------------------------------------

*osma betulina* [and r](#block-13-0)elated species but no published biosystematic studies are available. The essential oil components are well known (e.g. [Kaiser e](#block-11-0)t [al., 1](#block-11-0)975; [Posthumus \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-11-0\)996\)](#block-11-0) but the chemotaxonomic study of [Collins \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)l. \[\\(\]\(#block-10-0\)1996\) w](#block-10-0)as the first to provide d[eta](#block-10-0)ils of a chemical distinction between *Agathosma betulina* and the closely related *Agathosma crenulata* (L.) Pillans (oval leaf buchu), as well as their putative hybrids. *Agathosma crenulata* is less desirable because of potentially harmful levels of pulegone, which occur as the main compound in *Agathosma crenulata* oil (more than 30%) but less than 5% in *Agathosma betulina* oil. No information is available on the variation in the main flavonoids (diosmin and hesperidin) despite their importance in quality control of buchu products ([El-Shafae](#block-10-0) [and E](#block-10-0)l-Domiati, [2001\).](#block-10-0) Aspects of the autecology, genetics and chemical variation in *Agathosma betulina* are currently under investigation.

### 3.2. *Aloe ferox* Mill. (Asphodelaceae)-bitter aloe, Cape aloe

*Aloe ferox* is one of only a few plants depicted in San rock paintings ([Reynolds, 1](#block-12-0)950). The bitter latex, tapped from the leaves by a traditional method [and](#block-11-0) exported to Europe since 1761 ([Marloth,](#block-11-0) [1915; K](#block-11-0)ruger [and B](#block-11-0)eyers, [1977; R](#block-11-0)obertson, [1979; F](#block-11-0)orbes, [1986\),](#block-11-0) is known commercially as "Cape aloes". It has a long history of use in Africa and Europe as laxative medicine and is considered to have bitter tonic, anti-arthritis and anti-inflammatory properties ([Newall e](#block-11-0)t [al., 1](#block-11-0)996; [Blumenthal \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-11-0\)998; \[W\]\(#block-11-0\)ichtl \[a\]\(#block-13-0\)nd \[B\]\(#block-11-0\)isset, 2](#block-11-0)000; [ESCOP, 2](#block-11-0)003). The laxative effect is due to anthrone-C-glycosides, of which aloin (syn. barbaloin) is the main compound ([Van W](#block-12-0)yk [et a](#block-11-0)l., [1995\).](#block-12-0) Aloin occurs in tapped and dried leaf juice of *Aloe ferox* (so-called "Cape aloes") as a 1:1 mixture of aloin A and aloin B, at levels of about 10–28% dry weight ([Van \[W\]\(#block-12-0\)yk \[e\]\(#block-12-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-12-0\)995\).](#block-12-0) In recent years, the inner leaf parenchyma has become popular for skin care products and tonic drinks.

Th[e ta](#block-12-0)xonomy of *Aloe ferox* is well known ([Reynolds, 1](#block-12-0)950; [Glen](#block-12-0) [and H](#block-12-0)ardy, [2000; V](#block-12-0)an [Wyk a](#block-12-0)nd [Smith, 2](#block-12-0)003) and the species limits have been broadened to include *Aloe candelabrum* A.Berger, which is morphologically and chemically almost identical ([Viljoen](#block-12-0) [et \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-12-0\)996\).](#block-12-0) Variation in the phenolic compounds is well studied ([Van W](#block-12-0)yk [et \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-12-0\)995\).](#block-11-0) The gel polysaccharides are known to be of the arabinogalactan and rhamnogalacturonan types ([Mabusela](#block-11-0) [et \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-11-0\)990\)](#block-12-0) but hardly any research has been done on the leaf gel components or their claimed biological activities. *Aloe ferox* gel differs substantially from that of *Aloe ver[a](#block-12-0)* L. (notably in the absence of acetylated sugars) but limited d[eta](#block-12-0)ils are available (O'Brien, 2006; unpublished M.Sc. Thesis, University of Johannesburg). Only wildcrafted material is currently used, apparently without any damage to natural populations ([Newton a](#block-11-0)nd [Vaughan,](#block-11-0) [1996\),](#block-11-0) but the situation may change if there is a strong increase in demand. It may be possible to develop selections and cultivars with superior growth and quality. Some genetic markers have been studied ([Van d](#block-12-0)er [Bank e](#block-12-0)t [al., 1](#block-12-0)995a; [Van \[d\]\(#block-12-0\)er \[B\]\(#block-12-0\)ank \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)nd \[V\]\(#block-12-0\)an \[W\]\(#block-12-0\)yk,](#block-12-0) [1996\);](#block-12-0) markers such as RFPL, applied to gel identification of *Aloe* species by [Shioda e](#block-12-0)t al. [\(\[2003\\)\]\(#block-12-0\),](#block-12-0) may be useful to guide selection work.

### 3.3. *Artemisia afra* Jacq. ex Willd. (Asteraceae)-wild wormwood

This plant is one of the oldest [and b](#block-10-0)est-known of all the indigenous medicines in southern Africa and further north, up to Ethiopia. An exceptionally wide diversity of uses has been recorded ([Dykman,](#block-10-0) [1908; W](#block-10-0)att and [Breyer-Brandwijk, 1](#block-10-0)962; [Hutchings e](#block-10-0)t [al., 1](#block-10-0)996; [Van](#block-10-0) [Wyk \[e\]\(#block-10-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-10-0\)997; N](#block-10-0)euwinger, [1990;](#block-10-0) [Von K](#block-10-0)oenen, [2001\),](#block-10-0) including the treatment of colds, influenza, cough, sore throat, asthma, pneumonia, blocked nose, stomach ailments, colic, flatulence, constipation, gastritis, poor appetite, heartburn, internal parasites,

measles, headache, earache, gout, diabetes, malaria [and w](#block-10-0)ounds. The plant is a popular bitter tonic and appetite stimulant in the Cape region of South Africa ([Dykman, 1](#block-10-0)908; [Rood, 1](#block-10-0)994; [Thring](#block-10-0) and [Weitz, 2](#block-10-0)006).

The volatile oil is exceptionally variable ([Graven e](#block-10-0)t [al., 1](#block-10-0)990; [Lawrence, 1](#block-10-0)996; [Viljoen \[e\]\(#block-10-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-10-0\)006\),](#block-10-0) depending on the geographical origin. It is considered to be a useful substitute for armois oil. Often present are 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol),  $\alpha$ -thujone,  $\b[eta](#block-10-0)$ -thujone, camphor and borneol, tog[et](#block-11-0)her with some sesquiterpenoids such as chrysanthenyl ac[et](#block-12-0)ate.

### 3.4. *Aspalathus linearis* (Burm.f.) R. Dahlgren (Fabaceae)-rooibos tea

Rooibos tea is a traditional herbal tea of the Khoi-San people of the Cedarberg region of the Cape. Commercialization started in 1904 [and](#block-13-0) in 2003 exports to Germany alone exceeded local consumption. Rooibos tea has become popular as a health drink ([Watt a](#block-13-0)nd [Breyer-Brandwijk, 1](#block-13-0)962; [Van W](#block-13-0)yk [et a](#block-13-0)l., [1997; B](#block-13-0)urger [and W](#block-13-0)achter, [1998; V](#block-13-0)an [Wyk a](#block-13-0)nd [Gericke, 2](#block-13-0)000; [Van W](#block-13-0)yk and [Wink, 2](#block-13-0)004) and as an ingredient in cosm[et](#block-13-0)ics. There is increasing evidence of anti-mutagenic and antioxidant effects ([Von G](#block-13-0)adow [et \[a\]\(#block-13-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-13-0\)997; \[S\]\(#block-13-0\)tandley \[e\]\(#block-12-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-13-0\)l., 2](#block-13-0)001; [Joubert e](#block-13-0)t [al., 2](#block-13-0)003; [Marnewick \[e\]\(#block-13-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-13-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-13-0\)003, \[2\]\(#block-13-0\)005\).](#block-13-0) An animal study suggested the prevention of age-related accumulation of lipid peroxidases in the brain ([Inanami \[e\]\(#block-13-0\)t](#block-11-0) [al., 1](#block-13-0)995). Effects on cell division (Lamoš [ová \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t](#block-11-0) [al., 1](#block-11-0)997) and dermatological conditions ([Shindo a](#block-12-0)nd [Kato, 1](#block-12-0)991) suggest a rationale for the cosmetic use of rooibos tea extracts. See this volume for a more d[eta](#block-11-0)iled review.

*Aspalathus linearis* is exceptionally variable in its morphology ([Dahlgren, 1](#block-10-0)968, [1988\)](#block-10-0) and phenolic chemistry ([Rabe e](#block-12-0)t [al., 1](#block-12-0)994; [Van H](#block-12-0)eerden [et a](#block-12-0)l., [2003\).](#block-12-0) The chalcone aspalathin is the main

{6}------------------------------------------------

phenolic compound and is used for quality control ([Joubert, 1](#block-11-0)996; [Bramati e](#block-11-0)t [al., 2](#block-11-0)002, [2003\).](#block-11-0) The level varies greatly, from 1 mg/g for fermented tea up to 50 mg/g for green (unfermented) tea. The species is morphologically diverse and several different flavonoids are found in the main wild tea types. Considerable genetic diversity was detected by [Van d](#block-12-0)er [Bank \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l. \[\\(\]\(#block-12-0\)1995b\). O](#block-12-0)nly the so-called Red type or Rocklands type is cultivated, but there is a renewed interest in harvesting some of the wild types for niche markets ([Van W](#block-12-0)yk [et a](#block-12-0)l., [1997\).](#block-12-0) In view of the large variation in the phenolic compounds of wild tea types ([Van H](#block-12-0)eerden [et a](#block-12-0)l., [2003\),](#block-12-0) the m[eta](#block-12-0)bolomics approach may be useful in exploring the chemical rationale behind quality and flavour. Aspects of the seed biology, especially the relation between seed structure, dormancy, germination and early seedling growth, were studied by [Kelly a](#block-11-0)nd [Van](#block-11-0) [Staden \(](#block-11-0)1985, [1987\). S](#block-11-0)tudies of the autecology and the role of fire in the regeneration of populations could be of value in further crop development.

### 3.5. *Cyclopia genistoides* (L.) R.Br. (Fabaceae)-honeybush tea

Honeybush tea is a health beverage that has been wild-harvested in parts of the Cape for centuries. The original product was made from *Cyclopia genistoides* ([Marloth, 1](#block-11-0)925), a small shrub with narrow leaflets. The industry is small but is rapidly expanding, largely due to the work of [De L](#block-10-0)ange [\(1997\),](#block-10-0) who developed four species (*Cyclopia genistoides*, *Cyclopia intermedia* E. Mey., *Cyclopia subternata* Vogel [and \*C\*](#block-12-0)yclopia sessilifolia Eckl. & Zeyh.) into crop plants.

A d[eta](#block-12-0)iled revision of the genus *Cyclopia* ([Schutte, 1](#block-12-0)997) has resolved the species concepts but no biosystematic studies have yet been undertaken. As is the case with *Aspalathus linearis*, the fire-survival strategy ([Schutte e](#block-12-0)t [al., 1](#block-12-0)995) and reproductive biology of these fynbos plants needs further study. Some species and populations are resprouters (they survive fire [and s](#block-12-0)prout from the woody base) while others are reseeders—they are killed by fire and re-establish from seed. The seed physiology and seed germination of *Cyclopia* have been studied in d[eta](#block-10-0)il ([Sutcliffe a](#block-12-0)nd [Whitehead,](#block-12-0) [1995; W](#block-12-0)hitehead and [Sutcliffe, \[1\]\(#block-12-0\)995\)](#block-12-0) and some of the principles are already applied in commercial propagation. The phenolic constituents of honeybush tea were first studied by [De N](#block-10-0)ysschen [et \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)l.](#block-10-0) [\(1996\), w](#block-10-0)ho identified mangiferin and two flavonoids as the main compounds in practically all the species. Further work by [Ferreira](#block-10-0) [et \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)l. \[\\(\]\(#block-10-0\)1998\) d](#block-11-0)escribed the total phenolic complexity in more d[eta](#block-10-0)il, including the polyphenols in *Cyclopia intermedia* ([Kamara e](#block-11-0)t [al.,](#block-11-0) [2003\).](#block-11-0) M[eta](#block-12-0)bolomics may be a useful approach to learn more about the relation between chemical compounds, flavour profiles, processing methods and tea quality.

### 3.6. *Harpagophytum procumbens* (Burch.) DC. ex Meissn. (Pedaliaceae)-devil's claw

Devil's claw is an important traditional medicine [and](#block-11-0) tonic of the indigenous people of the countries surrounding the Kalahari region of southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) but there is a surprising lack of historical records ([Van W](#block-12-0)yk [et a](#block-12-0)l., [1997; V](#block-12-0)an [Wyk a](#block-12-0)nd [Gericke, 2](#block-12-0)000). Dried secondary roots of this widely distributed perennial are used, mainly against arthritis, painful joints, dyspepsia and loss of appetite ([Newall e](#block-11-0)t [al., 1](#block-12-0)996; [Blumenthal \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-11-0\)998; \[W\]\(#block-11-0\)ichtl a](#block-11-0)nd [Bisset, 2](#block-11-0)000; [ESCOP, 2](#block-11-0)003). Clinical studies, reviewed by [Wegener](#block-13-0) [\(2000\),](#block-13-0) [Chrubasik \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)l. \[\\(\]\(#block-10-0\)2003\) \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)nd \[G\]\(#block-10-0\)agnier \[e\]\(#block-10-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)l. \[\\(\]\(#block-10-0\)2004\) h](#block-10-0)ave confirmed the mild analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, usually ascribed to the iridoid glycosides (mainly harpagoside, with smaller amounts of harpagide and procumbide). Commercial product contains between 0.5% and 3% harpagoside. Other compounds

(such as phytosterols and sugars) may also play a role, as total extracts are more active than the individual iridoids ([Fiebich e](#block-10-0)t [al.,](#block-10-0) [2001; K](#block-10-0)aszkin [et a](#block-10-0)l., [2004\).](#block-10-0) A paper by [Stewart a](#block-12-0)nd [Cole \(](#block-12-0)2005) gives d[eta](#block-10-0)ils about all aspects of the product and its commercial harvesting.

The basic taxonomy of *Harpagophytum* is known ([Ihlenfeldt a](#block-10-0)nd [Hartmann, 1](#block-10-0)970), but there is a need for biosystematic studies. The circumscription of some of the species [and](#block-10-0) infraspecific taxa is not clear and the full morphological and chemical diversity remains to be explored. The taxa described by [Ihlenfeldt a](#block-10-0)nd [Hartmann](#block-10-0) [\(1970\) i](#block-10-0)nclude two species and five subspecies: *Harpagophytum procumbens* subsp. *procumbens*, *Harpagophytum procumbens* subsp. *transvaalensis* Ihlenf. & H.Hartm., *Harpagophytum zeyheri* Decne. subsp. *zeyheri*, *Harpagophytum zeyheri* subsp. *schiffii* Ihlenf. & H.Hartm. [and \*H\*](#block-10-0)arpagophytum zeyheri subsp. *sublobatum* (Engl.) Ihlenf. & H.Hartm. Studies in our laboratory showed that harpagoside may be completely absent from some populations of *H. zeyheri* despite the fact that this species is regarded as an acceptable alternative to *Harpagophytum procumbens* ([Czygan a](#block-10-0)nd [Krüger, 1](#block-10-0)977). Chemical variation at population level should be studied over the entire distribution range of the various taxa. Several studies have focused on the sustainability of harvesting and propagation methods but a deeper understanding of the autecology and reproductive biology of *Harpagophytum* species will be of considerable value as a source of basic information to guide ongoing crop development and propagation protocols. Recently there has been a considerable amount of tissue culture work done on *Harpagophytum* by the Plant Research Centre, University of KwaZulu-Natal in Pietermaritzburg, as well as crop development work by the University of Munster, Germany.

### 3.7. *Hoodia gordonii* (Masson) Sweet ex Decne (Apocynaceae)-hoodia, ghaap

The use of *Hoodia* species to suppress hunger and thirst appears to be an ancient [and w](#block-12-0)idespread practise of the Khoi-San people that was first recorded by [Marloth \(](#block-11-0)1932). The appetite-suppressant effect is due to a patented pregnane compound known as P57 ([Van](#block-12-0) [Heerden e](#block-12-0)t [al., 1](#block-12-0)998). *Hoodia* has become an interesting test case for the idea of financial compensation to rural communities for intellectual property rights (in this case, benefit-sharing with Khoi-San communities). The USA-based company Pfizer has announced that they are not proceeding with clinical trials to develop an anti-obesity drug but large-scale commercial developments are nevertheless underway.

The genus *Hoodia* has been taxonomically revised by [Whyte a](#block-13-0)nd [Sloane \(](#block-13-0)1937) [and](#block-13-0) more recently by [Bruyns \(](#block-10-0)1993), with contributions on the nomenclature published by [Plowes \(](#block-12-0)1992, [1996\).](#block-12-0) The species are beautifully illustrated and described in a recent book on the Stapelieae ([Bruyns, 2](#block-10-0)005). *Hoodia* species are known to have small and widely dispersed populations that make them vulnerable to overexploitation. The distinct morphological differences between populations may also be reflected in chemical patterns but no chemotaxonomic or biosystematic information has hitherto been published. A detailed review is published elsewhere in this volume.

### 3.8. *Hypoxis hemerocallidea* Fisch. & C.A. Mey. (Hypoxidaceae)-inkomfe, "African potato"

The so-called *African potato* (a recent name created for commercial reasons) is a well-known Sotho [and](#block-12-0) Zulu medicinal plant but surprisingly little traditional knowledge has been documented. Weak infusions and decoctions are taken as tonics against wasting diseases, including tuberculosis and cancer ([Van W](#block-12-0)yk and

{7}------------------------------------------------

[Gericke, 2](#block-12-0)000). *Hypoxis* has been used traditionally for benign prostatic hypertrophy and urinary tract infections, and as a laxative [and v](#block-11-0)ermifuge ([Van W](#block-12-0)yk [et a](#block-12-0)l., [1997\).](#block-12-0) The traditional use for benign prostatic hypertrophy is ascribed to sitosterols (mainly  $\b[eta](#block-10-0)$ -sitosterol), which decrease testosterone levels through inhibition of 5- $\alpha$  reductase, or by decreasing the binding of dihydrotestosterone within the prostate ([Bruneton, 1](#block-10-0)999). The so-called "African potato" or inkomfe (*Hypoxis hemerocallidea*) has become a household name ([Drewes a](#block-10-0)nd [Horn, 1](#block-10-0)999) but extracts of the plant, including rooperol ([Drewes e](#block-10-0)t [al., 1](#block-12-0)984) are no longer used for its patented ([Drewes a](#block-10-0)nd [Liebenberg, 1](#block-10-0)983) application against cancer. Likewise, the phytosterols used in immune-boosting products are no longer obtained from *Hypoxis hemerocallidea* ([Pegel, 1](#block-12-0)973, [1997\)](#block-12-0) but the corms of the plant are nevertheless processed on a small scale for various traditional tonics.

Taxonomic studies of *Hypoxis* are underway (Singh, 2003, cited in [Germishuizen a](#block-10-0)nd [Meyer, 2](#block-10-0)003) but the morphological, chemical [and g](#block-10-0)enetic diversity in *Hypoxis hemerocallidea* (formerly known as *H. rooperi*) remains unexplored. The plant is easy to grow but difficult to propagate, so that fundamental studies relating to the reproductive biology and seed physiology are obvious priorities. A considerable amount of work has already been done on tissue culture and seed germination ([Page a](#block-11-0)nd [Van S](#block-11-0)taden, [1984,](#block-11-0) [1986, 1](#block-11-0)987; [Hammerton \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)nd \[V\]\(#block-11-0\)an \[S\]\(#block-11-0\)taden, \[1\]\(#block-11-0\)988; \[H\]\(#block-11-0\)ammerton \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l.,](#block-11-0) [1989\).](#block-11-0)

### 3.9. *Lippia javanica* (Burm.f.) Spreng. (Verbenaceae)-fever tea

*Lippia javanica* is widely used as a tea to treat fever, coughs, colds [and b](#block-13-0)ronchitis ([Watt a](#block-13-0)nd [Breyer-Brandwijk, 1](#block-13-0)962; [Smith, 1](#block-13-0)966; [Hutchings e](#block-13-0)t [al., 1](#block-13-0)996; [Van W](#block-13-0)yk [et a](#block-13-0)l., [1997; V](#block-13-0)an [Wyk a](#block-13-0)nd [Gericke,](#block-13-0) [2000\).](#block-13-0) Other traditional uses that have been recorded include stomach problems, influenza, measles, malaria [and h](#block-10-0)eadache ([Hutchings](#block-10-0) [and V](#block-10-0)an [Staden, 1](#block-10-0)994; [Van \[W\]\(#block-13-0\)yk \[e\]\(#block-10-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-13-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-10-0\)997; \[V\]\(#block-10-0\)an \[W\]\(#block-10-0\)yk \[a\]\(#block-13-0\)nd \[G\]\(#block-10-0\)ericke,](#block-13-0) [2000\).](#block-10-0) Strong infusions are also used topically to treat rashes, scabies [and l](#block-10-0)ice. Hot leaf infusions (som[et](#block-12-0)imes with milk) ar[e ta](#block-13-0)ken as a general health tea. A review of the traditional uses, chemistry and pharmacology was presented by [Pascual](#block-12-0) [et \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l.](#block-10-0) [\(2001\).](#block-12-0)

This highly aromatic plant is rich in volatile oil that contains carvone, myrcene, myrcenone, caryophyllene, linalool, *p*-cymene, piperitenone, ipsenone [and](#block-12-0) ipsdienone (e.g. [Neidlein a](#block-11-0)nd [Staehle,](#block-11-0) [1974; M](#block-11-0)wangi [et a](#block-11-0)l., [1992; C](#block-11-0)hagonda [et a](#block-11-0)l., [2000; M](#block-11-0)anenzhe [et \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-11-0\)004; \[V\]\(#block-11-0\)iljoen \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l.,](#block-11-0) [2005\).](#block-11-0) The oil composition varies considerably within [and b](#block-10-0)etween populations and five different chemotypes were identified by [Viljoen e](#block-12-0)t [al. \(](#block-12-0)2005), with myrcenone, carvone, piperitenone, ipsenone or linalool, respectively as main compounds. The related *Lippia scaberrima* Sond. is also used in much the same way but the oil contains mainly carvone, 1,8-cineole and limonene ([Combrinck \[e\]\(#block-12-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-10-0\)006\).](#block-10-0) Iridoid glycosides ([Rimpler \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)nd \[S\]\(#block-12-0\)auerbier, \[1\]\(#block-12-0\)986\)](#block-12-0) [and t](#block-12-0)oxic triterpenoids (icterogenins) such as lantadene A and icterogenin have been detected in some *Lippia* species ([Barton a](#block-10-0)nd [De M](#block-10-0)ayo, [1954\).](#block-10-0)

The essential oil of *Lippia javanica* shows moderate antimicrobial activity against respiratory pathogens ([Manenzhe e](#block-11-0)t [al.,](#block-11-0) [2004; V](#block-11-0)iljoen [et a](#block-11-0)l., [2005\)](#block-11-0) and promising anti-inflammatory activity ([Frum](#block-10-0) [and V](#block-10-0)iljoen, [2006\).](#block-10-0) It may be interesting to study the possible role of non-volatile components, especially in terms of fever-reducing and possible pain-relieving activities.

### 3.10. *Mesembryanthemum tortuosum* L. [syn. *Sceletium tortuosum* (L.) N.E. Br.] (*Mesembryanthemaceae*)-*sceletium*, *kougoed*

*Kougoed*, *kanna*, *channa* or *sceletium* is a traditional sedative of the Khoi-San people of the dry western regions of South Africa. The uses [and p](#block-10-0)roperties of the plant have been known ever since it was first documented by the Cape Governor, Simon [van S](#block-10-0)tel, in 1685 ([Hartwich, 1](#block-10-0)911; [Zwicky, 1](#block-10-0)914; [Watt a](#block-10-0)nd [Breyer-Brandwijk,](#block-10-0) [1962; W](#block-10-0)att, [1967; D](#block-10-0)e [Wet a](#block-10-0)nd [Pheiffer, 1](#block-10-0)979; [Forbes, 1](#block-10-0)986; [Smith](#block-10-0) [et a](#block-10-0)l., [1996a; V](#block-10-0)an [Wyk a](#block-10-0)nd [Gericke, 2](#block-10-0)000; [Van W](#block-10-0)yk [and W](#block-10-0)ink, [2004; S](#block-10-0)cott [and H](#block-10-0)ewett, [2008\)](#block-10-0) but it is only recently that crop [and](#block-10-0) product development have been initiated. The activity of the plant is ascribed to mesembrine and other alkaloids, which have been shown to act as serotonin reuptake inhibitors ([Gericke a](#block-10-0)nd [Van W](#block-10-0)yk, [1997\).](#block-10-0)

The plant is a small, short-lived perennial succulent with fleshy leaves that become papery and scel[et](#block-11-0)onised in the dry season, hence the scientific name *Sceletium*. A large number of doubtful species have been described but a d[eta](#block-11-0)iled taxonomic revision is available ([Gerbaulet, 1](#block-10-0)996). At the generic level, the relationships and age of basal lineages within the family (and specifically the subfamily Mesembryanthemoideae) have been reported by [Klak e](#block-11-0)t [al. \(](#block-11-0)2004). A recent study has shown that the entire subfamily represents a single genus ([Klak e](#block-11-0)t [al., 2](#block-11-0)007) and all the existing genera were formally subsumed under the genus *Mesembryanthemum*. A survey of alkaloids in the family ([Smith e](#block-12-0)t [al., 1](#block-12-0)996a; [Gaffney, 2](#block-12-0)006) showed that several genera and species produce alkaloids. The species of commercial interest is *Mesembryanthemum tortuosum*, a highly variable plant with a wide distribution range ([Gerbaulet,](#block-10-0) [1996\).](#block-10-0) It differs from the seven close relatives in having straight secondary veins, prominent idioblasts, incurved leaf tips and imbricate leaves ([Gerbaulet, \[1\]\(#block-10-0\)996\).](#block-10-0) Variation studies in our laboratory has shown that some populations of *Mesembryanthemum tortuosum* are practically devoid of mesembrine-type alkaloids, while others have high yields of up to 2.4% of dry weight. As with so many African plants, the full morphological, chemical [and g](#block-10-0)enetic diversity of the species remains unknown, despite commercial interests. A more d[eta](#block-12-0)iled review of *Mesembryanthemum tortuosum* can be found elsewhere in this volume.

### 3.11. *Pelargonium sidoides* DC. (*Geraniaceae*)-*umckaloabo*, *rabas*

Traditional knowledge about this commercially important plant is poorly recorded ([Smith, 1](#block-12-0)895; [Van W](#block-12-0)yk [and G](#block-12-0)ericke, [2000\).](#block-12-0) The ethnobotanical and commercial history of the plant is reviewed by Brendler and [Van W](#block-10-0)yk (this volume). The tuberous roots are the raw material for an important German phytomedicine used mainly to treat acute bronchitis and infections of the upper respiratory tract (e.g. Matthis [et a](#block-11-0)l., [2003; A](#block-11-0)gbabiaka [et \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-11-0\)008\).](#block-11-0) Various biological activities have been reported, including immune stimulation ([Kayser e](#block-11-0)t [al., 2](#block-11-0)001), NO-induction and antibiotic effects ([Kayser](#block-11-0) [and K](#block-11-0)olodziej, [1997; K](#block-11-0)olodziej [et a](#block-11-0)l., [2003\).](#block-11-0) Recent studies showed clinically significant effects on nasal epithelial cells ([Neugebauer](#block-11-0) [et \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-11-0\)005\)](#block-11-0) and activity against mycobacteria ([Seidel a](#block-12-0)nd [Taylor,](#block-12-0) [2004; M](#block-12-0)ativandlela [et \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-12-0\)007\).](#block-11-0)

The medicinal properties are ascribed to at least eight different coumarins, of which umckalin and 5,6,7-methoxycoumarin are useful marker compounds ([Kayser a](#block-11-0)nd [Kolodziej, 1](#block-11-0)994, [1995, 1](#block-11-0)997; [Kolodziej \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)nd \[K\]\(#block-11-0\)ayser, \[1\]\(#block-11-0\)998; \[K\]\(#block-11-0\)ayser \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-11-0\)001\).](#block-11-0) Also present in the roots are gallic acids [and m](#block-10-0)ethyl esters of gallic acids, as well as flavonoids (quercetin), flavan-3-ols (catechin, gallocatechin) and phytosterols (sitosterol-3-glucoside).

The plant is a small perennial herb with tuberous rhizomes, rounded to heart-shaped and slightly silky leaves on long peti-

{8}------------------------------------------------

oles, [and](#block-12-0) small tubular flowers that are dark maroon red to almost black ([Van](#block-12-0) [der W](#block-12-0)alt, [1988;](#block-12-0) [Dreyer](#block-12-0) [and \[M\]\(#block-12-0\)arais,](#block-12-0) [2000;](#block-12-0) [Van W](#block-12-0)yk [and W](#block-12-0)ink, [2004\).](#block-12-0) The closely related *Pelargonium reniforme* is morphologically very similar but has pink flowers ([Van](#block-12-0) [der \[W\]\(#block-12-0\)alt,](#block-12-0) [1977; D](#block-12-0)reyer and [Marais, 2](#block-12-0)000). Morphological distinction of the dried product is extremely difficult, so that chemical analysis is the only reliable method. The major constituents in *Pelargonium sidoides* are umckalin and its 7-O-methyllether (=5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin) but these compounds are characteristically low or absent in *Pelargonium reniforme* ([Kolodziej a](#block-11-0)nd [Kayser,](#block-11-0) [1998\).](#block-11-0) Aspects of the micropropagation and morphological diversity of the species were reported by [Lewu e](#block-11-0)t [al. \(](#block-11-0)2006, [2007\).](#block-11-0) A d[eta](#block-11-0)iled study by [White e](#block-13-0)t [al. \(](#block-13-0)2008) has given valuable new insights into the effects of environmental stimuli on the level of umckalin in roots of wild and cultivated plants. No published information is as y[et a](#block-13-0)vailable on the basic biology, biosystematics [and g](#block-11-0)enetic diversity of *Pelargonium sidoides* and its relation with *Pelargonium reniforme* despite the commercial importance of these plants.

### 3.12. *Siphonochilus aethiopicus* (Schweinf.) B.L.Burtt (Zingiberaceae)-African ginger

African ginger is one of the most important [and](#block-13-0) most popular of all traditional medicinal plants of southern Africa ([Watt](#block-13-0) [and B](#block-13-0)reyer-Br[andw](#block-13-0)ijk, [1962; V](#block-13-0)an [Wyk e](#block-13-0)t [al., 1](#block-13-0)997; [Van W](#block-13-0)yk [and \[G\]\(#block-13-0\)ericke, \[2\]\(#block-13-0\)000; \[V\]\(#block-13-0\)an \[W\]\(#block-13-0\)yk a](#block-13-0)nd [Wink, 2](#block-13-0)004). The rhizomes and roots are used for a variety of ailments, including coughs, colds, asthma, headache, candida and malaria ([Watt a](#block-13-0)nd [Breyer-Brandwijk, 1](#block-13-0)962; [Van W](#block-13-0)yk [et a](#block-13-0)l., [1997; V](#block-13-0)an [Wyk a](#block-13-0)nd [Gericke, 2](#block-13-0)000; [Crouch \[e\]\(#block-13-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-13-0\)l.,](#block-13-0) [2000\).](#block-13-0)

African ginger is a deciduous geophyte with large, hairless leaves, a cone-shaped rhizome and spectacular pink flowers. Most plants are bisexual, and they have much larger flowers than female plants. The small, berry-like fruits are borne below or abov[e t](#block-11-0)he ground ([Kam, 1](#block-11-0)980; [Gordon-Gray e](#block-11-0)t [al., 1](#block-11-0)989; [Smith, 1](#block-11-0)998; [Van W](#block-11-0)yk [et a](#block-11-0)l., [1997; V](#block-11-0)an [Wyk a](#block-11-0)nd [Gericke, 2](#block-11-0)000; [Crouch \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-11-0\)000; \[V\]\(#block-11-0\)an \[W\]\(#block-11-0\)yk \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)nd \[W\]\(#block-11-0\)ink, \[2\]\(#block-11-0\)004\).](#block-11-0) The plant is morphologically uniform but genetically very polymorphic ([Makhuvha e](#block-11-0)t [al., 1](#block-11-0)997).

No comprehensiv[e ta](#block-10-0)xonomic studies have yet been done on the genus *Siphonochilus* and related genera and available knowledge comes mainly from Flora treatments ([Smith, 1](#block-12-0)998). The exact distribution of the species in Africa remains poorly known and no comprehensive distribution maps have yet been published. The main commercial species, *Siphonochilus aethiopicus*, is relatively well known as a result of its popularity in traditional medicine and concerns about its conservation status. It is often quoted as being locally extinct in some parts of South Africa as a result of over-exploitation. However, the plant is exceptionally easy to propagate and cultivate, so that small-scale cultivation is already underway. Aspects of the reproductive biology were studied by [Gordon-Gray](#block-10-0) [et \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)l. \[\\(\]\(#block-10-0\)1989\) b](#block-12-0)ut much interesting work remains to be done. The major chemical constituents are sesquiterpenoids of the furanoid type ([Van W](#block-12-0)yk [et \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l., \[1\]\(#block-12-0\)997; \[H\]\(#block-12-0\)olzapfel \[e\]\(#block-12-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-12-0\)002\) a](#block-12-0)nd chemical variation studies are ongoing. The composition of the essential oil was described by [Viljoen e](#block-12-0)t [al. \(](#block-12-0)[2002\).](#block-12-0) It contains high concentrations (up to 0.2% of dry weight) of a single compound loosely referred to as *Siphonochilus sesquiterpenoid* or siphonochilone ([Van \[W\]\(#block-12-0\)yk \[e\]\(#block-12-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l.,](#block-12-0) [1997; H](#block-12-0)olzapfel [et a](#block-12-0)l., [2002; V](#block-12-0)iljoen [et \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-12-0\)002\).](#block-12-0) Extreme genetic diversity was observed in a natural population ([Makhuvha e](#block-11-0)t [al.,](#block-11-0) [1997\),](#block-11-0) allowing for genetic fingerprinting at the clonal level. Further work showed that most of the southern provenances represent a single clone (Makhuvha [et a](#block-11-0)l., unpublished results) confirming traditional knowledge (C. Mutwa, personal communication to BEVW)

that African ginger (*isiphephetho* in isiZulu) is an ancient Zulu crop plant of tropical African origin.

### 3.13. *Sutherlandia frutescens* (L.) R.Br. [syn. *Lessertia frutescens* (L.) Goldblatt & J.C.Manning] (Fabaceae)-cancer bush, *sutherlandia*

The traditional claim that cancer bush "can be used for almost any disease" is perhaps the reason why this plant has never in the past received the serious attention that it deserved. The wide diversity of historical uses has been documented by [Smith \(](#block-12-0)1895), [Watt a](#block-13-0)nd [Breyer-Brandwijk \(](#block-13-0)1962) and in more d[eta](#block-12-0)il by [Van \[W\]\(#block-12-0\)yk a](#block-13-0)nd Albrecht (this volume). The plant is widely used by many cultural groups for fever, poor appetite, unspecified wasting diseases, indigestion, gastritis, oesophagitis, peptic ulcer, dysentery, cancer tonic (prevention and treatment), diabetes, colds, influenza, cough, asthma, chronic bronchitis, kidney and liver conditions, rheumatism, heart failure, urinary tract infections and stress and anxiety. Recent clinical anecdotes suggest dramatic improvements in the quality of life in HIV/AIDS patients, apparently by counter-acting the muscle-wasting (cachexia) effect of AIDS. A d[eta](#block-11-0)iled safety study has been completed by the Medicine Research Council of South Africa, showing no signs of toxicity in more than 50 parameters tested ([Seier e](#block-12-0)t [al., 2](#block-12-0)002). Like-wise, a clinical (phase I) study ([Johnson e](#block-11-0)t [al., 2](#block-11-0)007) found that 800 mg/day was well tolerated, with no indications of toxicity.

Chemical compounds isolated from the plant include pinitol, triterpenoid saponins (e.g. SU1), flavonoids [and s](#block-11-0)everal free amino acids, including L-cana[van](#block-11-0)ine and GABA. Canavanine is a potent L-arginine antagonist and has documented anticancer ([Swaffar,](#block-12-0) [1995;](#block-12-0) [Crooks a](#block-10-0)nd [Rosenthal, 1](#block-10-0)994) and antiviral activity, including inhibition of the influenza virus [and r](#block-10-0)[et](#block-12-0)roviruses ([Green, 1](#block-10-0)988). Canavanine is also an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and has potential for the treatment of septic shock. Pinitol is a known anti-diabetic agent that may have an application in treating wasting in cancer and AIDS ([Ostlund a](#block-11-0)nd [Sherman, 1](#block-11-0)996). Possible anti-diabetic uses have been reviewed by [Sia \(](#block-12-0)[2004\).](#block-12-0) GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that could partly account for the use of *Sutherlandia* for anxiety and stress ([Moteetee a](#block-11-0)nd [Van \[W\]\(#block-11-0\)yk, \[2\]\(#block-11-0\)007\)](#block-11-0). Recent studies have reported anti-cancer and antimutagenic effects ([Tai e](#block-12-0)t [al., 2](#block-12-0)004; [Reid \[e\]\(#block-12-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-12-0\)006; \[S\]\(#block-12-0\)tander \[e\]\(#block-12-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-12-0\)007\),](#block-12-0) anti-HIV activity ([Harnett e](#block-10-0)t [al., 2](#block-10-0)005) as well as stress-relieving properties (Prevo [et a](#block-10-0)l., [2004; S](#block-12-0)mith [and M](#block-12-0)yburgh, [2004\).](#block-13-0) The complex mixtures of saponins and flavonoids are the subject of ongoing studies.

*Sutherl[and](#block-12-0)ia* represents an intricate species complex with countless regional forms, genotypes and chemotypes. The basic taxonomy of [Phillips](#block-12-0) and [Dyer](#block-12-0) [\(1934\) w](#block-12-0)as revised by [Moshe](#block-11-0) [\(1998\), w](#block-11-0)ho recognized only two species, with several subspecies. [Goldblatt a](#block-10-0)nd [Manning \(](#block-10-0)2000) reduced the genus into synonymy under *Lessertia*, [and m](#block-10-0)ade the new combination *Lessertia frutescens* (L.) Goldblatt & J.C. Manning. This may be correct, but there are as yet no convincing morphological or molecular systematic studies to show that *Sutherlandia* is indeed nested within the genus *Lessertia* as the proposed new classification system suggests. Both names (*Sutherlandia frutescens* and *Lessertia frutescens*) are therefore widely used for the same plant.

Genetic diversity in *Sutherlandia* was explored using enzyme electrophoresis ([Moshe e](#block-11-0)t [al., 1](#block-11-0)998). It was found that the distinct morphological diversity (especially in fruit characters) is not reflected in the enzyme patterns. However, the idea that some hairy forms of *Sutherlandia frutescens* resulted from introgression with *Sutherlandia tomentosa* Eckl. & Zeyh. was supported by the study. The complexity in terpenoid and flavonoid patterns was first reported by [Moshe \(](#block-11-0)1998) and further work is ongoing.

{9}------------------------------------------------

### 3.14. *Warburgia salutaris* (Bertol.f.) Chiov. (*Canellaceae*)-pepperbark tree

Knowledge about this traditional medicine is surprisingly poorly recorded considering its obvious importance [and](#block-10-0) popularity. It is one of the great tonics and panaceas of southern Africa—the specific name *salutaris* means “salutory to health”. The bark is usually taken orally in a powdered form, or as infusions and decoctions. *Warburgia* is used as a tonic for all health conditions, including fever, malaria, colds, influenza, venereal diseases, abdominal pain, constipation, cancer, rheumatism, stomach ulcers, headache, as an expectorant in coughs, and as a natural antibiotic to treat chest infections ([Hutchings e](#block-10-0)t [al., 1](#block-10-0)996; [Van W](#block-10-0)yk and [Gericke, 2](#block-10-0)000). Tablets made from the leaves are used as a natural antibiotic, thought to be effective against oral and oesophageal thrush.

The basic taxonomy of *Warburgia* species was revised by Verdouw [\(1955,](#block-12-0) [1990\) a](#block-12-0)nd [Codd \(](#block-10-0)1976) but the relationships between the species and subspecies have remained poorly known. The described taxa are *Warburgia elongata* Verd., *Warburgia salutaris*, *Warburgia stuhlmannii* Engl., *Warburgia ugandensis* Sprague subsp. *ugandensis* and *Warburgia ugandensis* subsp. *longifolia* Verd. There are no modern studies exploring the circumscription and status of thes[e ta](#block-10-0)xa, but work is underway at the University of KwaZulu-Natal to study the genetic variation in *Warburgia*. Preliminary results revealed genetic differences in support of the idea of thre[e ta](#block-11-0)xa.

The bark contains drimane sesquiterpenoids such as warburganal and polygodial, both of which are known to be active against candida. Polygodial is potentially useful in clinical medicine as an adjuvant to treatment with antibiotics and antifungals that have poor membrane permeability ([Iwu, 1](#block-11-0)993). The compounds found in *Warburgia salutaris* ([Mashimbye e](#block-11-0)t [al., 1](#block-11-0)999) include warburganal, mukaadial, salutarisolide, polygodial and isopolygodial, as well as muzigadial ([Rabe a](#block-12-0)nd [Van S](#block-12-0)taden, [2000\).](#block-12-0) There are numerous phytochemistry reports based on single samples but possible differences between populations and species have hardly received any attention. Kiyo [et a](#block-11-0)l. [\(1990\) f](#block-11-0)ound no consistent differences in the sesquiterpenes and leaf volatile oils between *Warburgia ugandensis* and *Warburgia stuhlmannii*. A thorough biosystematic study of the genus *Warburgia* over its entire distribution range in Africa would clearly yield useful results.

### 3.15. *Xysmalobium undulatum* (L.) W.T.Aiton (*Apocynaceae*)-uzara

This important medicinal plant has a long history of traditional and commercial use, not only in South Africa (where it has been cultivated since 1904), but also in Germany, where it was introduced into the pharmaceutical market in 1911 ([Ghorbani e](#block-10-0)t [al., 1](#block-10-0)997). The traditional uses have been recorded by Thunberg ([Forbes,](#block-10-0) [1986\),](#block-10-0) [Watt \(](#block-13-0)1935), [Watt a](#block-13-0)nd [Breyer-Brandwijk \(](#block-13-0)1962), [Pujol \(](#block-12-0)1990), [Hutchings a](#block-10-0)nd [Van S](#block-10-0)taden [\(1994\), H](#block-10-0)utchings [et a](#block-10-0)l. [\(1996\), V](#block-10-0)an [Wyk](#block-12-0) [et a](#block-10-0)l. [\(1997\) \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)nd \[V\]\(#block-13-0\)on \[K\]\(#block-13-0\)oenen \[\\(\]\(#block-13-0\)2001\). D](#block-12-0)ecoctions of the bitter roots have been used since early times for stomach cramps, diarrhoea, colic and afterbirth cramps, while powdered root is sniffed to treat headache and hysteria or applied to wounds and abscesses. In Germany, extracts are used commercially against non-specific, acute diarrhoea.

The active ingredients are cardenolide glycosides, the structures of which were finally elucidated by [Ghorbani e](#block-10-0)t [al. \(](#block-10-0)[1997\).](#block-10-0) Uzarin and xysmalarin are the major compounds, with smaller amounts of allouzarin and alloxymsmalarin. These glycosides are known for their inhibitory effect on intestinal motility and their digitalis-like effects on the heart at high doses (e.g. [Wichtl](#block-13-0)

[and B](#block-13-0)isset, [2000\).](#block-13-0) Recent investigations focused on antibacterial [and](#block-10-0) antifungal activity ([Buwa](#block-10-0) [and \[V\]\(#block-10-0\)an](#block-12-0) [Staden,](#block-10-0) [2006\),](#block-10-0) possible CNS-activity ([Stafford e](#block-12-0)t [al., 2](#block-12-0)005), antibacterial, antioxidant and fibroblast growth stimulation activities ([Steenkamp \[e\]\(#block-12-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-12-0\)l.,](#block-12-0) [2004\),](#block-12-0) serotonin reuptake inhibition ([Nielsen \[e\]\(#block-12-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-11-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-11-0\)004\)](#block-11-0) and antiplasmodial activity ([Clarkson \[e\]\(#block-11-0\)t \[a\]\(#block-10-0\)l., \[2\]\(#block-10-0\)004\).](#block-10-0) The extent of variation in the main cardiac glycosides is not yet known. A paper dealing with *Xysmalobium undulatum* is included in this volume.

## 4. Discussion

The commercialization of southern African medicinal plants is a process that has been rapidly gaining momentum during the last 10 years. Before 1995, only nine of the 15 plants reviewed here have been developed to any extent. These are *Agathosma betulina*, *Aloe ferox*, *Aspalathus linearis*, *Cyclopia* species, *Harpagophytum procumbens*, *Hypoxis hemerocallidea*, *Lippia javanica*, *Pelargonium sidoides* and *Xysmalobium undulatum*. The remaining six (*Artemisia afra*, *Hoodia gordonii*, *Mesembryanthemum tortuosum*, *Siphonochilus aethiopicus*, *Sutherlandia frutescens* and *Warburgia salutaris*) are newcomers to the formal pharmaceutical market. The recent commercial interests in these species have also sparked a rapid increase in scientific research. Twelve years ago, there were hardly any scientific papers on the pharmaceutical activity of these plants, as is shown in [Table 2.](#block-3-0)

The need for fundamental studies, and specifically the biosystematics of commercially rele[van](#block-12-0)t species, was discussed by Van [Wyk \(](#block-12-0)1996) who proposed that “biosystematics can play an important role to ensure that we grasp the commercial opportunities provided by our genetically diverse flora”. These sentiments were echoed by [Smith e](#block-12-0)t [al. \(](#block-12-0)1996b), who provided a list of activities of the Plant Systematics Stimulation Programme (later the Working Group for Plant Systematics) to promote systematics research and concluded that “With its unsurpassed botanical diversity, southern Africa holds natural resources of global significance”. The development of medicinal plants species into new products and new crops is a complicated process that requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving biosystematics, ethnobotany, organic chemistry, pharmacology and horticulture. There is a need for taxonomic and systematic studies of the plants and their relatives in order to better understand the full genetic and m[eta](#block-12-0)bolic diversity at population and clonal levels, ethnobotanical studies to document and explore the socio-cultural context of the medicinal plants, chemical studies to identify the active chemical compounds or marker compounds, pharmacological studies to determine the mode of action, horticultural or autecological studies to find out if the plants are suitable for large-scale production or sustainable harvesting and finally, studies of the reproductive biology of the plants to develop propagation protocols and to guide crop development. The starting point for new innovations in the future will be fundamental biological knowledge about the species, including their phylogeny, taxonomy, genetics, chemical variation and reproductive biology.
