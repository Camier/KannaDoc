    ABSTRACT
   </h2>
   <p>
    <b>
     Aims of the study:
    </b>
    Commercially important indigenous medicinal plants of southern Africa are reviewed in the context of fundamental knowledge about their ethnobotany, phylogeny, genetics, taxonomy, biochemistry, chemical variation, reproductive biology and horticulture. The aim is to explore the rapidly increasing number of scientific publications and to investigate the need for further research.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Materials and methods:
    </b>
    The Scopus (Elsevier) reference system was used to investigate trends in the number of scientific publications and patents in 38 medicinal plant species. Fifteen species of special commercial interest were chosen for more detailed reviews:

     Results:
    </b>
    In recent years there has been an upsurge in research and development of new medicinal products and new medicinal crops, as is shown by a rapid increase in the number of scientific publications and patents. Despite the fact that an estimated 10% of the plant species of the world is found in southern Africa, only a few have been fully commercialized and basic scientific information is often not available.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Conclusions:
    </b>
    The limited available information indicates that some of the plants display remarkable regional variation in morphological, genetic and chemical characters that should be more thoroughly investigated. Basic biological information is needed to guide the rapidly accelerating commercialization process, especially the selection of superior clones, the development of new cultivars and the standardization of raw materials.

    1. Introduction
   </h2>
   <p>
    Africa, and especially southern Africa, has a rich diversity of plants. Recent statistics show that about 25% of the total number of higher plants in the world is found in Africa south of the Sahara. According to the "African Plant Checklist and Database Project" (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Klopper e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-11-0">al., 2</a>
    006), a total of 50,136 angiosperm taxa occur in tropical Africa and southern Africa. This figure is based on a recent merging of two major data bases—EPFAT (Énumération des plantes à fleurs d'Afrique) and FSA (Flora of southern Africa). The combined checklist shows a total of 32,424 taxa in tropical Africa and 22,755 taxa in southern Africa. A useful reference book on the medicinal plants of the whole of the African continent (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Neuwinger, 2</a>
    000) lists more than 5400 medicinal plant taxa and over 16,300 medicinal uses. It is generally accepted (e.g.

    <a href="#block-10-0">Van W</a>
    yk,
    <a href="#block-10-0">2002)</a>
    that natural resources will play a major role in the socio-economic development of the African continent. The angiosperm species count for southern Africa (
    <a href="#block-10-0">Germishuizen a</a>
    nd
    <a href="#block-10-0">Meyer, 2</a>
    003) is 21,817 and the count for the Cape Floristic Region (Goldblatt

    This paper is aimed at reviewing southern African medicinal plants that are currently of particular interest in new product development. Basic researches relating to 15 commercially highly relevant species in South Africa are briefly reviewed. The aim is to show the potential value and application of fundamental knowledge, to explore the rapidly accelerating numbers of scientific publications and to highlight the need for further biosystematic research on southern African plants.

    2. Commercialized indigenous plant species
   </h2>
   <p>
    Of the estimated 3000 medicinal plant species that are regularly used in traditional medicine in South Africa, only about 38 indigenous species have been commercialized to some extent (i.e. they are available as processed materials in modern packaging and in various dosage forms as teas, tinctures, tabl
    <a href="#block-10-0">et</a>
    s, capsules or ointments). Several others are also produced for multi-million Rand informal markets (
    <a href="#block-10-0">Cunningham, 1</a>
    988;
    <a href="#block-10-0">Mander, 1</a>
    998;
    <a href="#block-10-0">Williams e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-10-0">al., 2</a>
    000). A useful review of various aspects of the commercialization process in South Africa is given by
    <a href="#block-10-0">Diederichs (</a>
    2006). The major commercialized species are listed in
    <a href="#block-2-0">Table 1,</a>
    together with basic ethnobotanical information and some key references. The list includes indigenous species that are widely distributed in Africa and that have been extensively commercialized in other parts of Africa and/or in other parts of the world (e.g.
    <i>
     Adansonia digitata
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Centella asiatica
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Kigelia africana
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Prunus africana
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Trichilia emetica
    </i>
    ). Also included are two famous and popular herbs of Ayurvedic medicine that have hitherto been of limited commercial interest in South Africa (
    <i>
     Centella asiatica
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Withania somnifera
    </i>

    iled reviews in this volume.
   </p>
   <p>
    In order to gain some insight into the scientific and/or commercial interest in South African medicinal plants, a literature search was conducted with the well-known Scopus literature reference system maintained by Elsevier. Using the scientific names of the species and the "quick search" option, varying numbers of "hits" were obtained for those species listed in
    <a href="#block-2-0">Table 1. T</a>
    he searches were carefully executed to include main synonyms and other commercial species of the same genus where relevant (e.g.
    <i>
     Cyclopia
    </i>
    ). The results are summarized in
    <a href="#block-3-0">Table 2, w</a>
    hich outlines the number of scientific publications and the number of citation in patents in recent years. The general trend is one of an increasing number of papers and citations since 1995, although this is not true for all the species. The popularity of
    <i>
     Centella asiatica
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Withania somnifera
    </i>
    in Ayurvedic medicine is reflected in the large number of citations and publications over many years. Relatively large numbers are also seen for those species that are well established in tropical Africa as important medicinal plants (e.g.
    <i>
     Adansonia digitata
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Kigelia africana
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Prunus africana
    </i>
    ). These species have been of limited commercial interest in South Africa despite their popularity elsewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="#block-3-0">Table 2</a>
    reveals a rapid increase in the number of publications and patent citations for several indigenous species that were scientifically practically unknown and unstudied prior to 1995. Raw material of some species has only become available in commercial quantities in recent years, so that the number of ethnopharmacological studies has sharply increased since 1995. This trend was discussed by
    <a href="#block-11-0">Light e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-11-0">al. (</a>
    2005,
    <a href="#block-11-0">and r</a>
    eferences
    <a href="#block-11-0">cited t</a>
    herein) and is also reflected in review papers in this volume. In several cases, the number of scientific papers published since 2006 (i.e., a period of just over 2 years) already exceed those published in the preceding 5-year periods of 1995–2000 and 2001–2005. Notable examples are
    <i>
     Cyclopia genistoides
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Euclea natalensis
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Hoodia gordonii
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Hypoxis hemerocallidea
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Pelargonium sidoides
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Sutherlandia frutescens
    </i>
    . Rapid recent increases in the number of patent citations are also evident, especially for
    <i>
     Adansonia
    </i>
    ,

     Harpagophytum procumbens
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Aloe ferox
    </i>
    has been the subject of scientific investigation over many years. The decreasing trend in
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemum tortuosum
    </i>
    is due an early interest in the unique alkaloids of these plants and a rather slow pace of commercialization. Recent research and development activity is also reflected in the data for some well-established commercial species, including
    <i>
     Aspalathus linearis
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Xysmalobium undulatum
    </i>
    (both of which were first commercialized more than 100 years ago).

    popularity. It is one of the great tonics and panaceas of southern Africa—the specific name
    <i>
     salutaris
    </i>
    means “salutory to health”. The bark is usually taken orally in a powdered form, or as infusions and decoctions.
    <i>
     Warburgia
    </i>
    is used as a tonic for all health conditions, including fever, malaria, colds, influenza, venereal diseases, abdominal pain, constipation, cancer, rheumatism, stomach ulcers, headache, as an expectorant in coughs, and as a natural antibiotic to treat chest infections (

    The bark contains drimane sesquiterpenoids such as warburganal and polygodial, both of which are known to be active against candida. Polygodial is potentially useful in clinical medicine as an adjuvant to treatment with antibiotics and antifungals that have poor membrane permeability (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Iwu, 1</a>
    993). The compounds found in

    4. Discussion
   </h2>
   <p>
    The commercialization of southern African medicinal plants is a process that has been rapidly gaining momentum during the last 10 years. Before 1995, only nine of the 15 plants reviewed here have been developed to any extent. These are
    <i>
     Agathosma betulina
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Aloe ferox
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Aspalathus linearis
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Cyclopia
    </i>
    species,
    <i>
     Harpagophytum procumbens
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Hypoxis hemerocallidea
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Lippia javanica
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Pelargonium sidoides
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Xysmalobium undulatum
    </i>
    . The remaining six (
    <i>
     Artemisia afra
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Hoodia gordonii
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemum tortuosum
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Siphonochilus aethiopicus
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Sutherlandia frutescens
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Warburgia salutaris
    </i>
    ) are newcomers to the formal pharmaceutical market. The recent commercial interests in these species have also sparked a rapid increase in scientific research. Twelve years ago, there were hardly any scientific papers on the pharmaceutical activity of these plants, as is shown in
    <a href="#block-3-0">Table 2.</a>
   </p>
   <p>
    The need for fundamental studies, and specifically the biosystematics of commercially rele
    <a href="#block-12-0">van</a>
    t species, was discussed by Van
    <a href="#block-12-0">Wyk (</a>
    1996) who proposed that “biosystematics can play an important role to ensure that we grasp the commercial opportunities provided by our genetically diverse flora”. These sentiments were echoed by
    <a href="#block-12-0">Smith e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-12-0">al. (</a>
    1996b), who provided a list of activities of the Plant Systematics Stimulation Programme (later the Working Group for Plant Systematics) to promote systematics research and concluded that “With its unsurpassed botanical diversity, southern Africa holds natural resources of global significance”. The development of medicinal plants species into new products and new crops is a complicated process that requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving biosystematics, ethnobotany, organic chemistry, pharmacology and horticulture. There is a need for taxonomic and systematic studies of the plants and their relatives in order to better understand the full genetic and m
    <a href="#block-12-0">eta</a>
    bolic diversity at population and clonal levels, ethnobotanical studies to document and explore the socio-cultural context of the medicinal plants, chemical studies to identify the active chemical compounds or marker compounds, pharmacological studies to determine the mode of action, horticultural or autecological studies to find out if the plants are suitable for large-scale production or sustainable harvesting and finally, studies of the reproductive biology of the plants to develop propagation protocols and to guide crop development. The starting point for new innovations in the future will be fundamental biological knowledge about the species, including their phylogeny, taxonomy, genetics, chemical variation and reproductive biology.
