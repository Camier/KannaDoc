    ABSTRACT
   </h2>
   <p>
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    (Aizoaceae) is widely recognised for the treatment of stress, anxiety and depression, as well as for obsessive compulsive disorders. A comprehensive intraspecies chemotypic variation study, using samples harvested from two distinct regions of South Africa, was done using both proton nuclear magnetic resonance (
    <sup>
     1
    </sup>
    H-NMR) spectroscopy of methanol extracts (
    <math>
     N = 145
    </math>
    ) and ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) of acid/base extracts (
    <math>
     N = 289
    </math>
    ). Chemometric analysis of the
    <sup>
     1
    </sup>
    H-NMR data indicated two main clusters that were region-specific (Northern Cape and Western Cape provinces). Two dimensional (2D) NMR was used to identify analytes that contributed to the clustering as revealed by the S-plot. The sceletium alkaloids, pinitol and two alkylamines, herein reported for the first time from
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    , were identified as markers that distinguished the two groups. Relative quantification of the marker analytes conducted by qNMR indicated that samples from the Northern Cape generally contained higher concentrations of all the markers than samples from the Western Cape. Quantitative analysis of the four mesembrine alkaloids using a validated UPLC-photo diode array (PDA) detection method confirmed the results of qNMR with regard to the total alkaloid concentrations. Samples from the Northern Cape Province were found to contain, on average, very high total alkaloids, ranging from 4938.0 to 9376.8 mg/kg dry w. Regarding the Western Cape samples, the total yields of the four mesembrine alkaloids were substantially lower (averages 16.4–4143.2 mg/kg). Hierarchical cluster analysis of the UPLC-MS data, based on the alkaloid chemistry, revealed three branches, with one branch comprising samples primarily from the Northern Cape that seemed somewhat chemically conserved, while the other two branches represented mainly samples from the Western Cape. The construction of an orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis model and subsequent loadings plot, allowed alkaloid markers to be identified for each cluster. The diverse sceletium alkaloid chemistry of samples from the three clusters may facilitate the recognition of alkaloid profiles, rather than individual compounds, that exert targeted effects on various brain receptors involved in stress, anxiety or depression.

    A patent (USA patent 6,288,104) was filed in 1997 for the use of mesembrine and related compounds for treating a range of psychiatric and psychological conditions, including depression and drug dependence (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Gericke and Van Wyk, 1999</a>
    ). The best researched commercial product is marketed under the trade name Zembrin® and consists of a standardised hydroalcoholic extract of the aerial parts of the plant (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Murbach et al., 2014</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum

    occurs naturally in the Western, Eastern and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa, where small-scale cultivation for commercial use is currently practised. The plant is particularly abundant in the Knersvlakte and Upper Karoo regions (Northern Cape), the Great Karoo and Ceres Karoo and more moist parts of the Western Cape Province, and is also found in the Namaqualand Rocky Hills (spanning the Western and Northern Cape provinces) (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Gerbaulet, 1996</a>
    ). Populations native to the
   </p>
   <p>
    southern regions of Africa, including the Khoikhoi and San, have valued the beneficial properties of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    species for centuries (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Ilardi et al., 2009</a>
    ). Dried leaves of
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    are used in traditional practices to elevate mood and to alleviate anxiety and tension. Plant material is usually chewed, but is also smoked or taken as an infusion (

    geographical areas. However, the lack of data from plants growing in the Northern Cape Province necessitates further studies into the intraspecies chemotypic variation. This region is important from a historical perspective since the plant is widely used by the inhabitants (Gerick and Viljoen, 2008). Rapid progress in instrumentation and software has made nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy one of the most powerful analytical methods in metabolomics (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Larive et al., 2015</a>
    ). This technique can provide a wealth of accurate qualitative and quantitative information regarding the components of a mixture. In contrast to GC-MS and liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet and mass spectrometry (LC-UV/MS), the NMR approach does not rely on chromatographic separation. Hence, the loss of the whole metabolite information caused by the filtration through the chromatographic column can be avoided (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hall, 2006</a>
    ). Proton (
    <math>
     ^1\text{H}
    </math>
    -NMR) can simultaneously detect all proton-bearing compounds in a sample, which includes most organic compounds in plant tissues. Thus, NMR spectra of crude extracts of plants may provide a relatively unbiased fingerprint, consisting of overlapping signals of the majority of the metabolites present in the sample (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Ward et al., 2003</a>
    ). Factors that play a role in liquid chromatography analysis coupled to UV-radiation-based detectors or mass spectrometers, such as dependence on the absorbance of functional groups present and the ability of molecules to ionise, are not limiting factors in NMR analyses. Nevertheless, GC-MS and LC-UV/MS remain the techniques of choice for analysis of raw materials intended for herbal drugs, since these techniques result in complete separation and unequivocal identification of compounds in a mixture. For this reason, the chemical variation within a large number of
    <i>

    samples (two originating from the Northern Cape and three from the Western Cape provinces) illustrate compositional variation among the samples. It is evident that the variation is not limited to between the groups, but also within the groups.
   </p>
   <p>
    Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to visualize the data, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the clustering patterns displayed by the samples. The
    <math>

    -NMR data derived from the 145 samples were Pareto-scaled and used to construct a PCA model, in which 71% (
    <math>
     R^2X_{\text{cum}} = 0.71
    </math>
    ) of the variation within the data was explained by the first three principal components (PCs) with
    <math>
     R^2X
    </math>
    values of 0.51, 0.14 and 0.06 for PC1, PC2 and PC3, respectively. The PCA scores plot (PC1 vs PC3) demonstrates separation of the
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    samples from different provinces (
    <a href="#block-4-0">Fig. 3</a>
    A). Two main clusters were observed on the plot and the clustering was province-specific. Samples from the Northern Cape grouped together, and so did the Western Cape samples, indicating that within the province, the samples have similar chemical profiles and that they are conserved for the samples from a geographical region.
   </p>
   <p>
    To identify the marker NMR signals that are responsible for the discrimination of samples between the Northern Cape and the Western Cape provinces, a supervised algorithm, orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), was applied. This supervised model could be used to reveal the NMR signal variation between the two assigned classes, as reflected by separation in the first predictive component (tp1), while the within-class variation was indicated by the first orthogonal component (to1). The OPLS-DA scores plot (
    <a href="#block-4-0">Fig. 3</a>
    B) indicates a clear
   </p>
   <p>
    separation of the samples from the two provinces along the tp1. A greater variation within the Western Cape samples can be observed, since the samples are spread across both the positive and negative orthogonal component (to1) in a wider range. The high
    <math>

    2.24–2.36 ppm, which reflects significant and reliable contributions to the differentiation between the two sample groups. In the S-plot, variables on the extremities are highly discriminant and depending on the position, a correlation between the variables and observations at the corresponding position in the scores plot can be established. Conversely, variables at the centre of the plot are non-discriminatory and occur in almost all the samples. The positions of the most pronounced marker signals in the S-plot corresponded to the Northern Cape region in the OPLS-DA scores plot, indicating that these signals are predominant in the Northern Cape samples and play a significant role in differentiating samples from the two geographic regions.

    heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBc) and heteronuclear single quantum coherence-total correlation spectroscopy (HSQC-TOCSY) were applied to study the representative samples selected from the groups. In addition, the standard compounds and the proton/carbon NMR databases (ACD/NMR database) were used as references to assist with interpretation and to confirm assignments of the NMR spectral signals. The marker signals in the region of
    <math>
     \delta_H
    </math>
    3.80–3.88 ppm displayed high intensities for most of the samples from the Northern Cape group. They were singlet peaks that showed no COSY correlations with any other resonance peaks. The multiplicity-edited HSQC spectrum revealed that the signals accounted for methyl protons attaching to the carbons with chemical shifts at around
    <math>

    </math>
    55 ppm. These signals could be further assigned to the protons of methoxy groups on phenyl rings, based on the HMBc spectrum, in which these protons showed correlations only to the carbons at

    148–149 ppm. The

The 2D NMR experiments, together with the HSQC-TOCSY experiment, revealed the existence of a cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol structural unit.

     \delta_H
    </math>
    0.98–1.03 ppm). According to the 2D NMR analyses, they were the resonances from the protons of methyl groups. The COSY, HSQC and HMBC spectra further revealed that the signals were attributed to the methyl protons of two compounds, isobutylamine and 2-methyl-butanamine. The assignments were confirmed by using NMR spiking experiments, in which an increase of the signal intensity was observed after addition of standards of isobutylamine and 2-methyl-butanamine to the original NMR solution. The assignment was further confirmed by GC-MS analysis, in which the two compounds were identified in the total ion chromatogram.

    2.2. Quantitative NMR results
   </h3>
   <p>
    On the basis of the OPLS-DA model and constituent identity analyses, it was clear that the sceletium alkaloids, pinitol, and alkylamines (isobutylamine and 2-methyl-butanamine) are the marker constituents that make the greatest contribution to the separation of the Northern Cape group from the Western Cape group in the scores plot. To explore the quantitative information concerning these marker compounds in the two different locality groups, quantitative NMR (qNMR) analyses were conducted in this study. The amounts of the constituents in the extracts were measured based on the integration of the characteristic peak in the
    <math>

    ). Some samples collected from Steilsdrift (Western Cape) were found to contain more alkaloids than the other samples from the Western Cape. Samples from Vrolijkheid Nature Reserve, Vanwyksdorp, Beaufort West, Kontiki and Botmaskloof contained relatively lower alkaloid content when compared to samples from the Northern Cape Province. Among all the analysed samples, those collected from Paulshoek (Northern Cape) were on average the richest in sceletium alkaloids.

    The doublet peak in the region of

    3.90–3.94 ppm was used as the characteristic peak for pinitol qNMR analysis. Fig. 4B indicates the content distribution of pinitol in the samples from both the Northern Cape and Western Cape groups. It is clearly demonstrated that the Northern Cape samples contained more pinitol than their Western Cape counterparts. The average content of pinitol (
    <math>
     11.9 \pm 3.2
    </math>
    ) in the former was nearly double (
    <math>

    <math>
     p &lt; 0.00001
    </math>
    ) in the pinitol content of the two groups. Samples from Nourivier (Northern Cape Province) contained the most pinitol.

    The qNMR determination of the alkylamine content was performed based on the integration of the total characteristic peaks in the region of
    <math>
     \delta_H

    0.88–1.04 ppm, corresponding to the two methyl groups (
    <math>
     \delta_H
    </math>
    0.99–1.03 ppm) of isobutylamine and two methyl groups (
    <math>
     \delta_H
    </math>
    0.91–0.96 and 0.98–1.02 ppm) of 2-methyl-butan-amine. The average content (
    <math>
     14.5 \pm 8.1
    </math>
    ) of the alkylamines in samples from the Northern Cape was higher than for those samples in the Western Cape group (
    <math>
     5.8 \pm 1.6
    </math>
    ), showing significant differences (

    , t-test). Notably, the samples from Nourivier (Northern Cape) were found to possess not only the highest content of pinitol, but also the highest content of alkylamines (Fig. 4C). A Pearson's correlation analysis indicated a highly positive correlation (
    <math>
     r = 0.80
    </math>
    ) between the content level of pinitol and alkylamine for all the samples. However, the correlation coefficients for both the pinitol and the alkaloid pair (
    <math>
     r = 0.54
    </math>
    ), and the alkylamine and alkaloid pair (
    <math>
     r = 0.41
    </math>
    ), were low. It is not clear what biological relationship or mechanism is behind the positive correlation between pinitol and the alkylamines, since they belong to two different metabolite classes. Nevertheless, based on the qNMR results, it is likely that external and internal factors including soil, climate, precipitation and/or genetic factors, might contribute to the variation and correlation of the content levels for all the metabolites in

    .

    The intra-population variation of chemical profiles within both the Northern and Western groups was investigated further by creating two separate PCA models for the samples in each group. The Northern Cape samples (Supplementary S1) clustered according to different collection localities, with the exception of the samples from Ratelkraal that spread throughout the scores plot range and overlapped with others. Garing samples generally clustered on the positive side of PC1 and were separated along the PC1 axis from the Nourivier samples, which clustered on the negative side of PC1. The Paulshoek samples also showed a diagonal separation along the PC2 axis from the Nourivier samples. The dendrogram from hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Fig. 5</a>
    A) revealed that the samples could be clearly grouped into three classes, suggesting the occurrence of three major chemotypes in Northern Cape samples. The NMR signals that made a significant contribution towards the separation of the groups were revealed from by the corresponding loadings plot of the PCA model. Resonances derived from pinitol (3.92 and 3.64 ppm), alkylamines (0.88–1.04 ppm), and fatty acids (1.28–1.32 ppm), made the greatest contributions to the separation of Nourivier samples from the others, while the resonances of alkaloids (3.84–3.88 ppm) played a significant role in the separation of Paulshoek samples from Nourivier samples.
   </p>
   <p>
    The PCA model for the Western Cape samples indicated that there are no clear class separations for the groups according to locality (Supplementary S2). However, the HCA dendrogram (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Fig. 5</a>
    B) revealed that the samples were clearly grouped into two classes with a high Euclidean distance value (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Fig. 5</a>
    B), suggesting that two major chemotypes (type 1 and 2) can be distinguished for the Western Cape samples. Through analysis of the loadings plot it was found that fatty acids, alkaloids and pinitol, which were abundant in type 1 samples, contributed to the differences in the two chemotypes.

    2.3. Multivariate classification based on UPLC-MS data
   </h3>
   <p>
    To observe clearly the relationships among samples in the scores plot, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed and a dendrogram was constructed for the UPLC-MS data set. The
   </p>
   <p>
    interactive nature of the dendrogram and the scores plot allowed for easy identification and colour-coding of the different chemotypes in the data. To investigate the variation responsible for separation into the different classes, OPLS-DA was applied, based on the classes generated using HCA.

    The dendrogram of the UPLC-MS data indicates clear separation of the entire set of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    samples (
    <math>
     N = 289
    </math>
    ) into three branches; Cluster 1–Western Cape 1; Cluster 2–Northern Cape and Cluster 3–Western Cape 2 (Fig. 6A). These groups are displayed on the corresponding PCA scores plot (PC1 vs PC2) by using the colour groups from the dendrogram (Fig. 6B). Due to the highly variable alkaloid profiles of Western Cape samples, principal component analysis revealed two chemotypes in clusters 1 and 3. Cluster 1 (WC) samples were obtained from Ladismith, Calitzdorp, Merweville, Beaufort West, St Helena, Klaarstroom, Botmaskloof and Vrolijkheid. Cluster 3 (WC), which was more variable, comprised mainly samples from Steilskloof, Willowmore, Amalienstein, Oudtshoorn, Barrydale, Mosselbay, Volmoed, Van Wyksdorp, Ockertskraal and Kontiki. The results concur with the NMR data where two chemotypes were also identified independently, following multivariate analysis of the Western Cape samples. Cluster 2 (NC) spread along the positive PC1 comprised samples predominantly from the Northern Cape Province. The tight clustering observed confirms the
    <math>
     ^1\text{H}
    </math>
    -NMR results indicating that samples from the Northern Cape have a somewhat conserved chemical profile.
   </p>
   <p>
    To further investigate marker molecules responsible for the observed clusters, an OPLS-DA model of the three clusters (groups) was performed. Fig. 6C is the OPLS-DA scores plot of the observations, clearly indicating separation of the three pre-defined clusters. Chemical variation modelled along the first predictive component (Pp1) separated cluster 1 (WC1) and cluster 2 (NC) by 16.8% chemical variation. The second predictive component (Pp2 = 0.094), with a 9% modelled variation, positioned cluster 3 (WC2) on the Pp2 (+), while the other two clusters occupied Pp2 (–). In order to correlate the clustering patterns to the chemical profiles, a loadings plot of the variables was constructed (Fig. 6D). Distinctive discriminant variables, colour-coded to match the corresponding clusters in the scores plot, demonstrate that a typical Northern Cape chemical profile has high levels of compounds eluting at retention times (Rt) 3.3 and 4.7 min (Figs. 6D and
    <a href="#block-8-0">7A</a>
    ), identified as
    <math>
     \Delta^7

    -mesembrenone and mesembrine, respectively (

    -formyl mesembrenone (
    <a href="#block-8-0">Fig. 7</a>
    B,
    <a href="#block-9-0">Table 1</a>
    ). The loadings plot also filtered out compounds eluting at Rt 3.5, 3.7, 3.9 and 5.1 min as important variables in the classification of Western Cape 2 samples (Fig. 6D). The compounds were identified as mesembrenol, mesembranol, mesembrenone and sceletium alkaloid A4, respectively (
    <a href="#block-9-0">Table 1</a>
    ). A typical total ion chromatogram of the samples displaying the four alkaloids is presented in

    (Table 2), when compared to the others. The linearity of the calibration curves over the concentrations range (1.00–100 µg/mL) was confirmed by the high coefficients of determination (R
    <sup>
     2
    </sup>
    ) obtained (≥0.995). The LODs for the four alkaloids were similar and ranged from 0.101 µg/mL (mesembranol) to 0.166 µg/mL (mesembrenone). With the exception of mesembranol (84.9%), the recovery of the method was good (96.7–103% recovery). The small percentage RSDs (relative standard deviations) obtained for analyses conducted on the same, and consecutive days, indicated that the instrument yields repeatable results. These results indicate that the method was appropriate for the analysis of the
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    samples to determine the concentrations of the four alkaloids in the plant material.
   </p>
   <p>
    The actual concentration (mg/kg dry w.) of each alkaloid in the plant material was established from the line formula of the calibration curve (
    <a href="#block-10-0">Table 3</a>
    ). Samples from all four Northern Cape Province sites were found to contain, on average, very high total concentrations of alkaloids, ranging from 4465.6 ± 1095.7 to 9382.0 ± 2514.2 mg/kg dry w., with the lowest total alkaloid content measured as 1260.5 mg/kg dry w. in a sample from Ratelkraal. However, the total alkaloid yields of samples from the Western Cape Province were substantially lower, with the lowest average of 16.4 ± 12.5 mg/kg (Ladismith; N = 4) and the highest averages of 4143 ± 3586 mg/kg (Laingsburg; N = 7) and 3454 ± 1102 mg/kg dry w. (Amalienstein; N = 6). The majority of samples from this province contained less than 1000 mg/kg total alkaloids. These results correspond to those of qNMR. The production of alkaloids seems to be related to genetic make-up, rather than to climate, since samples from areas in close proximity to each other, with similar climates, produced variable amounts.
   </p>
   <p>
    The relative percentage concentrations of mesembrenol, mesembranol, mesembrenone and mesembrine were obtained by expressing each peak area as a percentage of the sum of the peak areas of all four alkaloids (Supplementary S3). Mesembrine was the dominant alkaloid in all 100 samples from the Northern Cape Province (
    <a href="#block-10-0">Table 3</a>
    ; Supplementary S3). The average relative percentage of mesembrine ranged from 87.3 ± 8.8% (Ratelkraal) to 95.6 ± 1.2% (Nourivier), while the corresponding average
   </p>
   <p>
    concentrations of mesembrine ranged from 4272.8 ± 1086.7 mg/kg (Nourivier) to 8651.7.0 ± 2451.2 mg/kg dry w. (Paulshoek). These results correspond to those from qNMR that indicated that these sites have the lowest and the highest alkaloid concentrations of samples from this province, respectively. This chemistry corresponds to chemotype C, which is characterised by high levels of mesembrine, as classified by
    <a href="#block-12-0">Shikanga et al. (2012)</a>
    in samples from the Western Cape Province. In that study, 25 of the 151 specimens (16.7%) contained mesembrine as the dominant alkaloid, while in the present study only 23 of the 189 samples (12.1%) from the Western Cape contained at least 50% mesembrine, relative to the other three alkaloids (Supplementary S3). The Middelkop region of the Western Cape Province (N = 6), on average, produced the most mesembrine (1797.9 ± 665.3 mg/kg), but this was substantially less than the concentrations in the Northern Cape samples (
    <a href="#block-10-0">Table 3</a>
    ). Mesembrine is known to be a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, indicating that the compound could act as an antidepressant (Gerické
    <a href="#block-12-0">and Viljoen, 2008; Harvey et al., 2011</a>
    ). Wild-harvested plants from the Northern Cape Province are an excellent and consistent source of
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    for commercial propagation to obtain botanical material destined for use as an antidepressant, since specimens from this region produce high levels of mesembrine and contain very low concentrations of the other three alkaloids. Low levels of mesembrenol (average concentrations 5.4–9.5 mg/kg dry w.) and mesembranol (average concentrations 10.9–19.0 mg/kg dry w.) were produced by the Northern Cape samples (
    <a href="#block-10-0">Table 3</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    In contrast to the samples from the Northern Cape Province, which were very consistent in their alkaloid profiles, the chemical compositions and yields of samples from the Western Cape Province were extremely variable. The effect of genetics on alkaloid production is also evident in that specimens differed greatly in the relative amounts of the four alkaloids. Samples from Beaufort West displayed huge variation with two of the ten samples producing exclusively mesembrenol, one producing only mesembranol, three only mesembrenone, and the remainder various ratios of two alkaloids. One sample did not produce any of the four alkaloids. Of all 289 samples analysed, eight samples (2.8%) did not produce any of the four alkaloids and these were all from the Western Cape, but from several sites. This chemical profile corresponds to chemotype A determined by
    <a href="#block-12-0">Shikanga et al. (2012)</a>
    in 19.9% of the samples from the Western Cape. Only 4.2% of our samples from the Western Cape were devoid of alkaloids.
   </p>
   <p>
    Samples from Amalienstein (N = 6) were the only samples to produce large quantities of mesembrenol (3170.3 ± 1021.4 mg/kg) and mesembranol (6340.7 ± 2043.5 mg/kg) (
    <a href="#block-10-0">Table 3</a>
    ). All six samples from this population produced mesembrenol and mesembranol in an approximately 1:2 ratio. The best producers of mesembrenone (1906.0 ± 1085.2 mg/kg) were from the Riversdale area (N = 5), while the best producers of mesembrine were from the Laingsburg region (N = 7; 2794.3 ± 3318.9 mg/kg dry w.). The highly variable nature of plant material from the Western Cape makes a strong case for only obtaining material for commercial use from cultivated stock. Although the earlier study of
    <a href="#block-12-0">Shikanga et al.</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">(2012)</a>
    also indicated that Western Cape samples could not be distinguished by their geographical location, this finding is not true

    for specimens from the Northern Cape. The results obtained in the current study confirm that climate is not a determining factor in the chemical profiles of the plant samples. The climate of the Northern Cape Province is dry and semi-arid with summer rainfall, while some of the Western Cape samples also originated from a similar climate (dry, semi desert zones, characterised by summer rainfall) and others came from more moist areas that experience both summer and winter rainfall.

    -NMR analysis of 145 samples collected from the different geographic locations revealed variations in their chemical profiles. Pinitol, alkaloids and alkylamines were identified as marker compounds that differentiate Northern Cape and Western Cape samples. qNMR analysis indicated significant differences in the contents of the marker compounds in samples of the two groups. In addition, the study revealed the occurrences of three and two chemotypes for Northern Cape and Western Cape samples, respectively.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chemometric analysis of the UPLC-MS data indicated the presence of two main groups corresponding to the provinces of origin. Samples from the Northern Cape Province produced substantially higher levels of the alkaloids and specifically mesembrine, which is
   </p>
   <p>
    regarded as of importance for the CNS effects.
    <math>
     \Delta^7
    </math>
    -Mesembrenone was identified as a second marker compound for this cluster. A greater degree of chemical variability was displayed by the Western Cape samples, dividing them further into two clusters. Mesembrenone, mesembranol and mesembrenol were identified as markers for Cluster 2, in addition to sceletium alkaloid A4. A compound, tentatively identified as
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    -demethyl-
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    -formyl mesembrenone, characterised samples from Cluster 3. This compound has not been reported from
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    before.
   </p>
   <p>
    This study has demonstrated that the NMR methodological approach, together with chemometric analysis, could be an effective tool for investigating metabolite variation in medicinal plants. Furthermore, the findings from this study could add value to the cultivation and better utilization of this indigenous medicinal plant from South Africa.

   <h3>
    4.2. Sample preparation
   </h3>
   <p>
    A representative subset (145) of the samples were analysed by NMR spectroscopy. The powdered samples (200 mg each) were extracted using 500
    <math>
     \mu
    </math>
    L deuterated methanol (
    <math>
     \text{CD}_3\text{OD}
    </math>
    , 99.8% D) obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. After being vortexed, the samples were sonicated at 25
    <math>
     ^\circ\text{C}
    </math>
    for 15 min and left to stand for 60 min. Thereafter, they were centrifuged at 13,400 rpm for 9 min using a high speed mini-centrifuge, and the supernatants were transferred to NMR tubes for analysis. The methanolic extract for GC-MS analysis was obtained in the same way as described, but methanol was used instead of deuterated methanol.
   </p>
   <p>
    For UPLC analysis, all the solvents and reagents used, including ammonia (25% w/w), dichloromethane, methanol and sulfuric acid, (98% w/w) were AR grade and were purchased from Merck (Germany). Initially the methanol extracts were analysed by UPLC, but the alkaloid concentrations were low and it was therefore decided to extract the alkaloids from all 289 samples using typical acid/base extraction as described by
    <a href="#block-12-0">Alali et al. (2008)</a>
    , with modifications. Briefly, 60 mL of 0.25 M sulfuric acid was added to 5.00 g of the powdered plant material. After manual shaking, the mixture was filtered and subsequently basified by adding 30 mL of a 20% (v/v) ammonia solution. Alkaloids were extracted into dichloromethane (2
    <math>
     \times
    </math>
    35 mL). The combined extracts were evaporated to dryness. Prior to UPLC analysis, the dried extract was re-dissolved in methanol (1 mg/mL) and filtered through a 0.2

The spectra were manually phased and baseline corrected using Mnova software v. 9.0 (Mestrelab Research S.L.), while TSP was used as the internal standard reference. Two dimensional NMR analysis, including COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC and HSQC-TOCSY were recorded on selected samples. The measurements of 2D spectra were performed using the standard pulse sequences of Vnmrj 4.0. The optimized coupling constants for HSQC and HMBC were 145 and 8 Hz, respectively. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the HSQC-TOCSY experiment.

    The PDA detector was used for quantitative analysis of the four mesembrine alkaloids in the plant extracts, while the qToF-MS was used for confirmation of identification. Method validation was carried out according to the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines (
    <a href="#block-12-0">ICH, 1994</a>
    ). The linearity of the calibration curve for each alkaloid standard was determined by triplicate analysis of seven calibration standards with concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 100
    <math>
     \mu\text{g}/\text{mL}
    </math>
    in methanol. The accuracy of the method was determined by comparing the average alkaloid concentrations obtained for the 2.50, 25.0 and 100
    <math>
     \mu\text{g}/\text{mL}
    </math>
    calibration standards measured from six replicate analyses. Intra- and inter-day precision of the method was established by repeatedly analysing a sample containing known concentrations of the four mesembrine alkaloids. On the first day (intra-day) the sample was analysed six times. For interday variation, the samples were analysed three times a day for three days, after fixed time intervals. The results were expressed as the %RSD of the measurements. In addition, the limits of detection (LOD) and

    4.7. Multivariate data analysis
   </h3>
   <p>
    To investigate chemical variation within
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    samples from different geographical locations, NMR spectroscopy and UPLC-MS were used to generate two data sets based on the methanol and acid/base extracts, respectively. Due to the multivariate nature of the data obtained, chemometric tools were applied to extract chemical variability information from these large data sets. The NMR spectra were bucketed with an equal bin width of 0.04 ppm over the region
    <math>
     \delta
    </math>
    0.6–8.6 ppm, after performing the calibration and normalization using the signal of TSP at chemical shift

    ppm. The spectral regions from
    <math>
     \delta
    </math>
    4.60–5.10 ppm and 3.29–3.31 ppm were excluded to eliminate the effects of water suppression and residual methanol signal. The data set was exported to SIMCA-P+14.0 (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden) for chemometric analysis. The UPLC-MS data was pre-processed using MarkerLynx™ v4.1 (Waters Cooperation, USA), a software that allows comprehensive analysis of 'all' chromatographic peaks in a non-selective manner. During data pre-processing, parameters were set to enable baseline correction, noise elimination, peak selection and spectral alignment of all mass fragments across the sample set. The resulting pre-processed data comprising retention time, mass pairs (variables) and the corresponding amplitudes across the samples was exported to SIMCA-P+14.0.
   </p>
   <p>
    Multivariate analysis tools that reveal clustering patterns in a dataset were employed to investigate chemical relationships among
    <i>
     S. tortuosum
    </i>
    samples. Initially, unsupervised PCA was applied to the data to investigate the direction of maximum variation. Various scaling methods were investigated and the method that generated the best statistical parameters was selected for further model development. The results for each dataset were analysed in a scores plot, which reveals clustering patterns, and a loadings plot that displays chemical variables that contribute to the patterns observed. To observe clearly the relationships among samples in the scores plots obtained, HCA was performed and dendrograms were constructed.
   </p>
   <p>
    To investigate further the variation responsible for separation into the different classes, a supervised algorithm, OPLS-DA, was applied. Predictive variation was modelled separately from orthogonal variation, thus clearly demonstrating variation between the classes. The loadings plots obtained from the various models were used to identify variables correlated to the different chemotypes observed. A group to average comparison of the variables for each chemotype was performed to confirm the results of the loadings plots. The model performances were evaluated by considering the cumulative variation within X (
    <math>
     R^2X_{cum}
    </math>
    ) and the predictive ability of the model (
    <math>
     Q^2_{cum}
    </math>
    ).
