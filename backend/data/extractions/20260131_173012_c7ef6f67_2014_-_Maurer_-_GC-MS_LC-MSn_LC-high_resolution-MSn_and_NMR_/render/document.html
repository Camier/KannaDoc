     Abstract
    </b>
    Mesembrine and mesembrenone are the main alkaloids of
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    , a plant species that was used for sedation and analgesia by the KhoiSan, previously known as Hottentots, a tribe in South Africa. After fermentation, the obtained preparation called “Kanna” or “Kougoed” was used by chewing, smoking, or sniffing. Today, Kanna gains popularity by drug users as legal high. For monitoring such consumption, metabolism studies are mandatory because the metabolites are mostly the analytical targets, especially in urine. Therefore, the metabolism of both alkaloids was investigated in rat urine and pooled human liver preparations after several sample work-up procedures. As both alkaloids were not commercially available, they were isolated from plant material by Soxhlet extraction, and their identity confirmed by NMR. The metabolites were identified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography coupled to linear ion trap high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HR-MS
    <sup>
     n
    </sup>
    ). Both alkaloids were
    <i>
     O
    </i>
    - and
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    -demethylated, dihydrated, and/or hydroxylated at different positions. The phenolic metabolites were partly excreted as glucuronides and/or sulfates. Most of the phase I metabolites identified in
   </p>
   <p>
    rat urine could be detected also in the human liver preparations. After a common user’s low dose application of mesembrine, mainly the
    <i>
     O
    </i>
    - and
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    demethyl-dihydro, hydroxy, and
    <i>
     bis
    </i>
    -demethyl-dihydro metabolites, and in case of mesembrenone only the
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    -demethyl and the
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    -demethyl-dihydro metabolite could be detected in rat urine using the authors’ standard urine screening approaches (SUSA) by GC-MS or LC-MS
    <sup>
     n
    </sup>
    . Thus, it should be possible to monitor a consumption of mesembrine and/or mesembrenone assuming similar pharmacokinetics in humans.

    Africa. Different preparations, such as herbs, powders, capsules, and extracts were called “Kanna” or “Kougoed” and administered by chewing, smoking, or sniffing for sedation and analgesia [
    <a href="#block-16-0">5</a>
    ]. The alkaloids were tested by Harvey et al. in receptor and enzyme binding studies as well as in cell assays [
    <a href="#block-16-0">6</a>
    ]. An ethanolic extract showed strong inhibition of the 5-HT transporter (
    <math>
     IC_{50}
    </math>
    , 4.3
    <math>
     \mu
    </math>
    g/mL) and of the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4;
    <math>
     IC_{50}
    </math>
    ,
    <a href="#block-16-0">8</a>
    .5
    <math>
     \mu
    </math>
    g/mL). These values were given in
    <math>
     \mu
    </math>
    g/mL as the extract contained a mixture of alkaloids. Further experiments elucidated that mesembrine had the lowest
    <math>
     K_i
    </math>
    value (1.4 nM) for the 5-HT transporter, whereas mesembrenone showed the strongest inhibition effects against PDE-4 (
    <math>
     IC_{50}
    </math>
    , &lt;1
    <math>
     \mu
    </math>
    M). Further clinical trials and experiments in humans confirmed these finding with antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of the extract [
    <a href="#block-16-0">7</a>
    ,
    <a href="#block-16-0">8</a>
    ]. Besides the medical use, Kanna preparations (e.g., herb, powder, capsules, extracts), available in so-called smart shops, are misused as legal highs [
    <a href="#block-16-0">7</a>
    , 8]. During the last decade, such legal highs gained popularity in the drug scene, and their detection in screening approaches represent a major challenge in clinical and forensic toxicology [
    <a href="#block-16-0">9</a>
    ]. Urine screening is the most comprehensive approach, covering a broad range of (also low dosed) drugs with a longer detection window than blood, but mostly the metabolites are the analytical targets. Thus, the metabolism and the detectability of new drugs in urine have to be studied.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such data are missing for mesembrine and mesembrenone and, therefore, the aim of the presented study was the identification of the phase I and II metabolites in rat urine and human liver preparations using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography linear ion trap high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HR-MS
    <sup>
     n
    </sup>
    ). The reference standards were commercially not available and had to be isolated first from the plant material. In addition, the detectability of mesembrine, mesembrenone, and/or its metabolites should be assessed using the authors' standard urine screening approaches (SUSA) by GC-MS [

Ready-to-use pH 10 buffer for the conversion of the hydrochlorides to the free amines was delivered from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). The following enzyme sources were from Gentest and delivered by NatuTec (Frankfurt/Main, Germany): baculovirus-infected insect cell microsomes (Supersomes), containing 1 nmol/mL of the human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 (CYP) CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and 2 nmol/mL CYP2E1, CYP3A4, or CYP3A5, human liver microsomes [HLM, pooled of 25 donors, 20 mg microsomal protein/mL, 330 pmol total cytochrome P450 (CYP)/mg protein], and human liver cytosol (HLC, pooled of ten donors, 20 mg protein/mL). After delivery, the microsomes, HLM and HLC were thawed at 37 °C, aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use.

    Isolation of mesembrine and mesembrenone
   </h3>
   <p>
    The plant material was pulverized and 50 g portions were extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with 500 mL of a mixture of n-pentane:n-hexane (1:1 v/v) for 1 h. After drying the plant material, additional stepwise extraction with a total volume of 500 mL dichloromethane was performed for 6 h. Combined dichloromethane extracts were evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 40 °C and the residue was treated with 0.5 M HCl and stirred for 1 h on an ice bath. After filtration, the acidic solution was basified with 0.5 M NaOH to pH 8–9 and extraction was performed with chloroform (4×300 mL). Combined extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 40 °C. The extract was separated by column chromatography with basic aluminum oxide (activity stage III) as stationary phase and gradient elution with chloroform and methanol:ammonia mixture (99:1, v/v), from 99.9 to 90 %. To improve the flow rate, the column was set under slight pressure (
    <math>
     N_2
    </math>
    ). Both alkaloids were obtained in the form of brown oils. They were solved in diethyl ether and precipitate by dropwise addition of 2 M HCl (in diethyl ether) in the form of their hydrochlorides. After centrifugation, the solid products were washed with diethyl ether and dried under vacuum at 30 °C to give white to slightly yellow crystalline powders.

   <p>
    For identification of phase I metabolites by GC-MS, 1 mL urine (rat urine after 20 mg/kg BW drug administration) was processed by enzymatic cleavage of conjugates and SPE (HCX) according to Reference [

    ]. Briefly, the enzymatic cleaved urine was loaded on an Isolute Confirm HCX cartridges previously conditioned with methanol and water. After passage of sample, cartridge was washed with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid and purified water. Elution was performed with a mixture of methanol and ammonia (98:2 v/v). The evaporated extracts were acetylated after addition of 100

    GC-MS standard urine screening protocol

   <p>
    The rat urine samples (after low dose of 1 mg/kg BW) were worked-up according to published procedures [
    <a href="#block-16-0">10</a>
    ,
    <a href="#block-16-0">12</a>
    ]. Briefly, the samples (5 mL) were divided into two aliquots, and one part was submitted to acid hydrolysis. Thereafter, the sample was adjusted to pH 8–9 and the other aliquot of untreated urine was added. This mixture was extracted with a dichloromethane-isopropanol-ethyl acetate mixture (1:1:3 v/v/v) and the organic layer was evaporated to dryness. The residue was acetylated with an acetic anhydride-pyridine mixture using microwave irradiation (400 W, 5 min). Following evaporation, the residue was dissolved in 100 µL methanol and 2 µL were injected onto the same GC-MS and as described above.

    For toxicologic detection of both alkaloids and their metabolites, mass chromatography was used with the extracted ions for mesembrine at

    70, 299, 314, 316, 359, and 387. Generation of the mass chromatograms was performed with user defined macros [
    <a href="#block-16-0">12</a>
    ]. The identity of the peaks in the mass chromatograms was confirmed by comparison of the mass spectra underlying the peaks (after background subtraction) with reference spectra recorded during this study. In addition, the full scan data files acquired by GC-MS were evaluated by the automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system (AMDIS) (
    <a href="http://chemdata.nist.gov/mass-spc/amdis/">http://chemdata.nist.gov/mass-spc/amdis/</a>
    ) in simple mode. The deconvolution parameter settings were as follows [
    <a href="#block-16-0">19</a>
    ]: width 32; adjacent peak subtraction two; resolution high; sensitivity very high; and shape requirements low. The minimum match factor was set to 50. The target library was a reduced version of the Maurer/Pfleger/Weber MPW_2015 library in preparation.

    Isolation of mesembrine and mesembrenone
   </h3>
   <p>
    The two step extraction procedure by Soxhlet apparatus allowed elimination of lipids by using the nonpolar n-pentane:n-hexane mixture before the extraction was performed with dichloromethane. An elimination of these lipids was important, because lipids, especially fatty acids, may interfere with the following isolation procedure because of their emulsifying properties, for example by phase separation in liquid–liquid extraction. Further gummy material from the plant was eliminated by the following liquid–liquid back extraction under acidic or alkaline pH conditions. Unfortunately, only the rather toxic chloroform allowed sufficient extraction [
    <a href="#block-16-0">10</a>
    ]. However, these purification procedures resulted in a lower alkaloid yield, as well as better separation conditions by the following column chromatography. The advantage of the basic aluminum oxide compared with silica [
    <a href="#block-16-0">20</a>
    ] was the absence of strong tailing effects of mesembrine and mesembrenone and acceptable separation conditions by column length of 30 cm. Subsequent conversion of the isolated oily bases in their hydrochlorides improved purity, handling of substances, and their solubility important for further experiments. The minor alkaloids, such as mesembranol,

    showed resonances for a
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    -methyl octahydroindol-6-one and a 3,4-dimethyloxyphenyl moiety. The chemical shifts were close to those of mesembrine, but the resonances for the pyrrolidine ring protons appeared remarkably shifted downfield. These were good arguments for the existence of protonated mesembrine, and the 2D NMR analysis supported this structure. Unfortunately, a comparison with literature data was not possible. Therefore, as a final proof, the hydrochloride was converted to the free base. Its NMR data were in good accordance with those of mesembrine [
    <a href="#block-16-0">21</a>
    ]. It is noteworthy, that the NMR spectra of mesembrine hydrochloride recorded in
    <math>
     \text{D}_2\text{O}
    </math>
    showed not a single set of signals for the structure but resonances for two conformers in a 1:1 ratio. This observation coincided with results from literature, in which Jeffs [
    <a href="#block-16-0">22</a>
    ] reported a normal carbonyl and a carbonyl hydrate conformer for mesembrine hydrochloride in aqueous solution.
   </p>
   <p>
    In contrast to mesembrine hydrochloride, the NMR spectra of mesembrenone hydrochloride in
    <math>
     \text{D}_2\text{O}
    </math>
    lack two methylenes but revealed additional resonances for a disubstituted double bond between C-4 and C-5 in conjugation to the carbonyl C-6. But much to our surprise in the
    <math>
     ^1\text{H}
    </math>
    NMR no protons for methylene C-7 could be detected and in the
    <math>
     ^{13}\text{C}
    </math>
    NMR the resonance for C-7 appeared as a broad multiplet. It was obvious that under these conditions, both H-7 were undergoing a deuterium exchange. This could be explained as a consequence of a keto-enol tautomerism. The carbonyl C-6 is in rapid equilibrium with the enol tautomer C-6/C-7, which contains a pair of doubly bonded carbon atoms adjacent to a hydroxyl group. In
    <math>
     \text{D}_2\text{O}
    </math>
    solution, a deuterium will be exchanged in the hydroxyl group. The interconversion of the keto-enol forms involves the movement of the deuterium atom to C-7. Our data recorded in
    <math>
     \text{D}_2\text{O}
    </math>
    were similar to those in
    <math>
     \text{CDCl}_3
    </math>
    reported from literature [
    <a href="#block-16-0">23</a>
    ]. But it must be mentioned that our mesembrenone hydrochloride recorded in
    <math>
     \text{CDCl}_3
    </math>
    showed not only one but resonances of two conformeric forms. Basification of our mesembrenone hydrochloride led to the free alkaloid mesembrenone. Its NMR data matched the data from literature [

    Identification of mesembrine phase I metabolites by GC-MS
   </h3>
   <p>
    All GC-MS spectra of mesembrine and its metabolites are depicted in Fig.
    <a href="#block-7-0">1</a>
    . If the position of the metabolic change in the molecule could not be determined, the resulting bond is indicated by a tilde. In case of the
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    alkaloids, Martin
   </p>
   <p>
    et al. elucidated the structures in detail by MS, HR-MS, labeling experiments, and analysis of metastable transitions [
    <a href="#block-16-0">3</a>
    ]. These data were used for further structure elucidation of the resulting metabolites and derivatized structures. The mass spectrum of underivatized mesembrine (Fig.
    <a href="#block-7-0">1a</a>
    ) is characterized by the base peak at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    218 resulting of formation of an aryl conjugated pyrrolidinium ion (
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    219) after loss of a hydrogen, by the allyl iminium ion at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    70, and the pyrrolidinium ion at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    96. Besides these main fragment ions (FI), further fragmentations were observed from the molecular ion (MI) and/or the FI: radical loss of methyl group and/or loss of hydrogen to give several less abundant FI. Due to keto-enol tautomerism, acetylation of the enol function could be observed (Fig.
    <a href="#block-7-0">1b</a>
    ) and led to the shifted MI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    <a href="#block-16-0">3</a>
    31. In contrast to the underivatized mesembrine (Fig.
    <a href="#block-7-0">1a</a>
    ) and mesembrenone (Fig.
    <a href="#block-9-0">2a</a>
    ) with strongly different mass spectra, the acetylated compounds (Figs.
    <a href="#block-7-0">1b</a>
    and
    <a href="#block-9-0">2b</a>
    ) showed similar fragmentation with identical FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    58, 86, and 100 and FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    229, 231, 243, 245, 256, and 258 with two mass units (
    <math>
     -2\text{H}
    </math>
    ) less caused by the additional double bond in mesembrenone. The fragmentation was strongly dependent on the degree of saturation of the six member ring. In case of the dihydro metabolite of mesembrine (mesembranol), without any carbon double bond in the indole moiety, the mass spectrum was different (Fig.
    <a href="#block-7-0">1e</a>
    ) and showed, besides the loss of the acetyl group from MI to FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    290, a following radical loss of a methyl group and loss of hydrogen to FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    274. Further explanation for FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    274 could be the loss of acetic acid from MI. Due to reduction of the keto group, FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    258 (Fig.
    <a href="#block-7-0">1b</a>
    ) was shifted by two mass units to FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    260. In contrast to the unsaturated compounds, FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    70, 96, and 219, observed in the underivatized mesembrine spectrum, could also be detected in the dihydro metabolite spectrum. Radical loss of a methyl group from FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    219 led to FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    204. These results were consistent with the observations by Martin et al. [3]. The demethyl metabolite (Fig. 1i) showed analogue fragmentation behavior: identical FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    58, 86, and 100 as well as FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    217, 231, 244 (
    <math>
     -14\text{ u}
    </math>
    in comparison to mesembrine). Besides the demethyl metabolite, three demethyl-dihydro metabolites with MI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    361 could be detected (Fig.
    <a href="#block-7-0">1d, h, j</a>
    ). Due to the saturated indole moiety, the fragmentation differed from the demethyl metabolite and correlated with the dihydro metabolite: loss of an acetyl group followed by hydrogen loss to FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    318 and a loss of acetic acid to FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    302 could be monitored. Further loss of the second acetyl group from FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    302 led to FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    260. For these compounds, fragmentations took place with minor abundance differences. For differentiation of the possible
    <i>

    ): loss of acetyl group from MI at

    287 and 245 (additional loss of hydrogen
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    244). Elimination of acetic acid led to FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    330 or radical loss of a methyl group to FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    374. A differentiation between
    <i>
     O,O-bis
    </i>
    - or
    <i>

    </i>
    -demethyl compounds were not possible because all compounds contained FI at

    163. In addition, two other compounds with MI at

     m/z
    </math>
    389, but with different fragmentation, were observed (Fig.
    <a href="#block-7-0">1f, g</a>
    ). Due to their fragmentation, hydroxy metabolites could be postulated: loss of an acetyl group led to FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    346 and loss of acetic acid to FI at
    <math>
     m/z

    330. Combined loss of an acetyl group and acetic acid was represented by FI at

    288. A dihydro-hydroxy metabolite was detected after loss of water (Fig.

    Identification of mesembrenone phase I metabolites by GC-MS
   </h3>
   <p>
    All GC-MS spectra of mesembrenone and its metabolites are depicted in Fig.
    <a href="#block-9-0">2</a>
    . The mass spectrum of mesembrenone (Fig.

     m/z
    </math>
    287, base peak at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    70, and the minor abundant aryl conjugated pyrrolidinium ion at

     m/z
    </math>
    219 as described by Martin et al. [
    <a href="#block-16-0">3</a>
    ]. As already discussed above, the acetylated spectrum (Fig.
    <a href="#block-9-0">2b</a>
    ) of mesembrenone showed nearly the same fragmentation as acetylated mesembrine (Fig.
    <a href="#block-7-0">1b</a>
    ). The spectrum of the dihydro-metabolite (mesembrenol, Fig.
    <a href="#block-9-0">2c</a>
    ) is characterized by the base peak at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    70 and FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    288 and 272 resulting from cleavage of acetyl group or acetic acid, respectively. The demethyl metabolite (Fig. 2i) showed analogue fragmentation behavior as mesembrenone: same FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    58, 86, 100, and FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    215, 229, 242, and
    <a href="#block-16-0">3</a>
    15 (

     -14
    </math>
    in comparison to mesembrenone). FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    284 resulted from radical loss of a methoxy group from FI at
    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    315. Besides the
    <i>

    </i>
    -demethyl metabolite, three demethyl-dihydro metabolites with MI at

     m/z
    </math>
    359 could be detected (Fig.

    <math>
     m/z
    </math>
    316. Loss of acetic acid to FI at

     m/z
    </math>
    300 could only be monitored for one isomer (Fig.

    </math>
    56 (

    <i>
     N
    </i>
    -demethylated metabolite (Fig.
    <a href="#block-9-0">2j</a>
    ). The characteristic FI at

    </math>
    u in the mono-demethylated compounds to FI at

    </math>
    205 [3] and after acetylation to FI at
    <math>
     m/z

     m/z
    </math>
    415 and FI at

   <p>
    Using the authors' GC-MS SUSA, an intake of mesembrine or mesembrenone could be detected in rat urine at least after a 1 mg/kg BW dose. This dose should correspond to a higher user's dose extrapolating the described plant dosage and average alkaloid content (
    <a href="http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=Kanna">http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=Kanna</a>
    ). A similar dosage was given in a controlled study with a standardized plant extract [
    <a href="#block-16-0">7</a>
    ]. In case of mesembrine, toxicologic detection should be focused on the acetylated demethyl-dihydro and hydroxy metabolite; for mesembrenone the demethyl-dihydro being the most abundant metabolites in the rat urine. Using the authors' LC-MS

   <h2>
    Conclusions
   </h2>
   <p>
    The presented study has shown that mesembrine and mesembrenone were extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, dealkylation, dihydration,
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    -oxidation, and combinations of them. This helped in studying the detectability of a mesembrine or mesembrenone administration because the metabolites were the main targets in urine. Thus, it should be possible to monitor an application of mesembrine and/or mesembrenone assuming similar pharmacokinetics in humans.
