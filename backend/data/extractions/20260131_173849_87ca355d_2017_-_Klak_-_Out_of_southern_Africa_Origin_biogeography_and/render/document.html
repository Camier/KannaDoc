    ABSTRACT
   </h2>
   <p>
    The Aizooideae is an early-diverging lineage within the Aizoaceae. It is most diverse in southern Africa, but also has endemic species in Australasia, Eurasia and South America. We derived a phylogenetic hypothesis from Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses of plastid DNA-sequences. We find that one of the seven genera, the fynbos-endemic
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    , does not belong to the Aizooideae, but is an ancient sister-lineage to the subfamilies Mesembryanthemoideae &amp; Ruschioideae.
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    are embedded inside
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Aizoonthemum
    </i>
    is polyphyletic. The Namibian endemic
    <i>
     Tetragonia schenckii
    </i>
    is sister to
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    of the Sesuvioideae. For the Aizooideae, we explored their possible age by means of relaxed Bayesian dating and used Bayesian Binary MCMC reconstruction of ancestral areas to investigate their area of origin. Early diversification occurred in southern Africa in the Eocene-Oligocene, with a split into a mainly African lineage and an Eurasian-Australasian-African-South American lineage. These subsequently radiated in the early Miocene. For
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    , colonisation of Australasia via long-distance dispersal from Eurasia gave rise to the Australasian lineage from which there were subsequent dispersals to South America and Southern Africa. Despite the relatively old age of the Aizooideae, more than half the species have radiated since the Pleistocene, coinciding with the large and rapid diversification of the Ruschioideae. The lineage made up of
    <i>
     Tetragonia schenckii
    </i>
    &amp;
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    split from the remainder of the Sesuvioideae already in the mid Oligocene and its disjunct distribution between Namibia and north-east Africa may be the result of a previously wider distribution within an early Arid African flora. Our reconstruction of ancestral character-states indicates that the expanding keels giving rise to hygrochastic fruits originated only once, i.e. after the split of the Sesuvioideae from the remainder of the Aizoaceae and that they were subsequently lost many times. Various winged and spiky fruits, adapted to dispersal by wind and animals, have evolved independently in the Aizooideae and the Sesuvioideae. There is then a greater diversity of dispersal systems in the earlier lineages than in the Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae, where dispersal is mainly achieved by rain.

   <h2>
    1. Introduction
   </h2>
   <p>
    Earlier phylogenetic studies of the Aizoaceae using chloroplast (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al., 2003</a>
    ) and nuclear markers (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Thiede, 2004</a>
    ) showed that each of the four subfamilies (Aizooideae, Mesembryanthemoideae, Ruschioideae and Sesuvioideae) is monophyletic. For three of the subfamilies, the Mesembryanthemoideae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Klak et al., 2007</a>
    ), the Ruschioideae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Klak and Bruyns, 2012; Klak et al., 2013; Klak</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">et al., 2015</a>
    ) and the Sesuvioideae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hassan et al., 2005; Thulin</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">et al., 2012; Bohley et al., 2015</a>
    ), much denser sampling led to a better understanding of relationships within them. For the
   </p>
   <p>
    Aizooideae,
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al. (2003)</a>
    sampled all currently recognized genera, but only nine of the 125 species and so phylogenetic relationships within the Aizooideae are the least understood in the family.
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al. (2003)</a>
    showed that the Aizooideae consisted of two major clades: one containing
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Gunniopsis
    </i>
    and one made up of
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Aizoonthemum
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    . The small genus
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    S.Moore, formerly placed with
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    in the subfamily Tetragonioideae, was found to be a close relative of the Sesuvioideae.
    <a href="#block-13-0">Thulin et al. (2012)</a>
    later confirmed this position and transferred a second species,
    <i>
     Tetragonia retusa
    </i>
    Thulin to
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    . The two species of
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    differ remarkably in their fruits:
    <i>
     T. retusus
    </i>
    (Thulin) Thulin &amp; Liede has winged, simple fruits (as in many
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    from southern Africa), while
    <i>
     T. dimorphanthus
    </i>
    has a compound, spiny fruit.

    Seven genera and 125 species make up the Aizooideae. Over 70% of them occur only in southern Africa (Table 1,
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">2015</a>
    ), but 30 are endemic to Australasia, Eurasia and South America and one is cosmopolitan (

    and for the endemic Australian
    <i>
     Gunnioopsis
    </i>
    by
    <a href="#block-12-0">Chinnock (1983)</a>
    . The subfamily is diverse, with annuals, perennials and geophytes and its members vary in size from small, prostrate or erect herbs to large shrubs. Characteristics of the Aizooideae, as well as the Sesuvioidae, are a basic chromosome number of
    <math>
     n=8
    </math>
    , only slightly succulent leaves and flowers consisting of tepals, which are petaloid inside and sepaloid outside (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich and Hartmann, 1988</a>
    ). The presence of epidermal bladder hairs has been suggested as a possible synapomorphy for the Aizooideae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich, 1990a; Klak et al., 2003</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    In the Aizooideae xerochastic or hygrochastic capsules as well as woody or rarely drupaceous fruits are found. Hygrochastic capsules (which open when moistened and close again when dried out) divided into locules are typical for the Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae and are also found in all genera of the Aizooideae (except
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    ), but are not present in the Sesuvioidae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich, 1990a</a>
    ). The advantages of hygrochasy for dispersal of seeds, especially where rainfall is erratic, has been dealt with extensively (e.g.
    <a href="#block-12-0">Ihlenfeldt, 1983; Hartmann, 1988;</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">Parolin 2001, 2006</a>
    ). Opening of the capsule is achieved by 'expanding tissue' (present in the 'expanding keels'), which swells when it becomes wet and pushes the valves of the capsules open. Seeds are then splashed out of the open capsule by rain. As the capsules dry out, the expanding tissue contracts again and pulls the valves closed. In this way the seeds are dispersed over longer periods (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Ihlenfeldt, 1983; Parolin 2001</a>
    ). Only a few species in the Ruschioideae (e.g. the 11 species of the
    <i>
     Apatesieae
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Stoeberia gigas
    </i>
    Dinter &amp; Schwantes) and Mesembryanthemoideae (e.g.
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemum nucifer
    </i>
    (Ihlenf. &amp; Bittrich) Klak) lack expanding tissue (and have xerochastic rather than hygrochastic capsules). In the Aizooideae the formation of expanding tissue is variable: in
    <i>
     Gunnioopsis
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Aizoonthemum
    </i>
    the fruits are hygrochastic with fully functioning expanding keels; in
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    the expanding tissue is much reduced; in
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    the expanding tissue is absent (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 2001</a>
    ). Whereas the fruits of
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    are capsules, those of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    are woody and nut-like and may be winged or variously sculptured (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 2001</a>
    ). Morphologically and anatomically the expanding keels are so similar among the subfamilies that they are thought to have evolved just once in the Aizoaceae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich,</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">1990a</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    In the Aizoaceae, age has been estimated only for the hyperdiverse Ruschieae (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al., 2004; Arakaki et al., 2011; Valente</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">et al., 2014</a>
    ). Two of these give a recent age of c. 8 Ma, whereas the third is slightly older at 17 Ma (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Arakaki et al., 2011</a>
    ). The two
   </p>
   <p>
    younger estimates support the hypothesis that the radiation post-dates the establishment of an arid environment in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (of southern Africa) at 10–15 Ma (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Cowling</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">et al., 2009</a>
    ). The younger dates are further corroborated by a major increase in fossilized Aizoaceae pollen after 8 Ma (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Dupont et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">2011</a>
    ). Much less is known about the ages of other subfamilies in the Aizoaceae. It is possible that the species-rich
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    diversified rapidly and relatively recently, as did the Ruschieae. Alternatively, the diversity may be the result of a gradual accumulation of species from old lineages (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Linder, 2008;</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">Verboom et al., 2009; Valente et al., 2010, 2011</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    The origins of the endemic species of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    in South America and Australasia are similarly uncertain. So far, these disjunctions have been interpreted as examples of long distance dispersals from Africa (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich, 1990a; Taylor, 1994</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Here we sampled both the morphological diversity and the geographical distribution of the genera better than before for the Aizooideae. This allows us to investigate generic monophyly and relationships between the species. In addition, we ask what the phylogeny reveals about the biogeographical history of the subfamily. In particular, since the subfamily is so widely distributed (relative to the other subfamilies), we aim to estimate both the timing of the disjunctions and the direction in which the events of trans-oceanic dispersal took place. We also briefly discuss morphological attributes of the fruits to reveal patterns underlying the radiation of the Aizooideae.

    2. Materials and methods
   </h2>
   <h3>
    2.1. Sampling of taxa
   </h3>
   <p>
    93 accessions of the Aizooideae from 62 out of 125 species (i.e. 50% of the species) were sampled, with more than one accession for several of the widespread and variable species (
    <a href="#block-3-0">Table 3</a>
    ). Representatives were chosen to cover both the morphological diversity and the geographical range of the Aizooideae and therefore included accessions from Australia and New Zealand, Chile (representing South America), the Mediterranean (southern Europe and North Africa –representing Eurasia), as well as Namibia and South Africa in southern Africa as well as East Africa. The greatest number of species is found in southern Africa (
    <a href="#block-2-0">Table 2</a>
    ) and consequently the most species were sampled from here. Outgroups were chosen from the subfamilies Mesembryanthemoideae, Ruschioideae and Sesuvioidae to test the monophyly of the Aizooideae (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">2003</a>
    ). As further outgroups we chose members of the Amaranthaceae, Anacampserotaceae, Didiereaceae, Gisekiaceae, Kewaceae, Nyctaginaceae and Phytolaccaceae, which are possibly closely related to the Aizoaceae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hernández-</a>
    Ledesma et al., 2015) and we rooted the tree with
    <i>
     Plumbago europaea
    </i>
    L. (Plumbaginaceae) (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hernández-Ledesma et al., 2015</a>
    ). The material sampled is listed with GenBank accession numbers in
    <a href="#block-3-0">Table 3</a>
    , where details of the vouchers are also provided. Most of the samples were collected by the authors between 2013 and 2015.
   </p>
   <h3>
    2.2. Plant material, DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing and alignment
   </h3>
   <p>
    Total DNA was isolated (from fresh leaves or from material dried in silica) using the Invisorb Spin Plant Mini Kit (STRATEC Biomedical AG, Birkenfeld, Germany). For optimal homogenization of tissue samples the FastPrep®-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Santa Ana, CA, USA) was used. We sampled four chloroplast gene-regions, which were amplified from total DNA by PCR. Primers used for amplification of
    <i>

    were
    <i>
     rpsF

    and

    (

    </sub>
    and dNTPs, with 0.3 M of each primer and 1 L of unquantified DNA template. Thermocycling was carried out on a TProfessional Basic Thermocycler (Biometra GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) to the following thermal conditions, initial denaturation at 97 °C for 2 min., followed by 30 cycles of 97 °C for 1 min., 52 °C for 1 min., 72 °C for 2 min., with a final extension step of 72 °C for 7 min. Quality of PCR products was checked by agarose electrophoresis. For samples with weak PCR products (less than 20 ng/L of DNA), the PCR cycling conditions described in
    <a href="#block-13-0">Shaw</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">et al. (2007)</a>
    were used: initial denaturation at 80 °C for 5 min.; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min., a ramp of 0.3 °C/s to 65 °C and kept at 65 °C for 4 min., with a final extension step of 65 °C for 5 min. For removing of unincorporated primers and nucleotides before sequencing we used clean-up reaction with exonuclease I and alkaline phosphatase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The PCR products were sent to Macrogen Europe (Netherlands) for automated sequencing. The primers used for amplification were also used for the sequencing reactions.

    Data files were assembled and edited using GeneDoc version 2.6.002 (

    2.3. Phylogenetic analyses
   </h3>
   <p>
    The combined chloroplast data was analysed with RAxML (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Stamatakis, 2006</a>
    ) using the CIPRES Portal version 2.2 (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Miller</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">et al., 2010</a>
    ), which delivered a maximum likelihood tree with bootstrap node support. In addition, we performed analyses using Bayesian Inference (BI), also with the CIPRES Portal version 2.2 (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Miller et al., 2010</a>
    ) and with MrBayes 3.1.2 (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Ronquist and</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">Huelsenbeck, 2003</a>
    ). The data were partitioned into the four regions, with parameters (statfreq, revmat, shape, pinvar) all unlinked between the partitions. Following the recommendation by
    <a href="#block-12-0">Huelsenbeck and Rannala (2004)</a>
    the most complex model GTR + G + I was implemented for each partition. Several analyses were conducted with four Markov Chains in each of two
   </p>
   <p>
    independent runs with the following settings, 10
    <sup>
     7
    </sup>
    generations, with trees sampled every 1000th generation. After 10
    <sup>
     7
    </sup>
    generations it was found that the standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01 and the analysis was discontinued. In each analysis, by examining the decrease in the standard deviation of split frequencies, it was found that chains had achieved stability within the first quarter of the samples so burnin was set to 2500. The most likely tree was selected from among those found. From the 7501 trees remaining after the burnin was discarded, a 50% majority rule consensus tree and posterior probabilities (PP) were calculated. Supports for the nodes in the tree selected were taken from these PP values. Clades with posterior probabilities greater than 0.95 were considered significantly supported (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Alfaro and Holder, 2006</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition, we repeated the above BI analysis, where we included the
    <i>
     trnL-F
    </i>
    (AJ558040) and
    <i>
     rps16

    (AJ532736) accessions of “
    <i>
     Acrosanthes teretifolia

    ” (

    2.4. Divergence time estimation
   </h3>
   <p>
    Previous estimates of divergence times of the core Ruschioideae (the tribes Ruschieae &amp; Drosanthemeae) (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al., 2004; Valente</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">et al., 2014</a>
    ) used a calibration age from
    <a href="#block-13-0">Wikström et al. (2001)</a>
    , where ages were estimated from an angiosperm-wide tree using non-parametric rate smoothing (NPRS).
    <a href="#block-12-0">Arakaki et al. (2011)</a>
    , on the other hand, used the estimated age of pollen from the fossil
    <i>
     Chenopodipollis multiplex
    </i>
    (believed to belong to the Amaranthaceae,
    <a href="#block-13-0">Nichols and Traverse, 1971</a>
    ), as a minimum age for nodes within the Caryophyllales.
    <i>
     Plumbago
    </i>
    was used to root the tree and we dated the split of Amaranthaceae from the remainder of the Caryophyllales at 65–56.5 Mya (as in
    <a href="#block-12-0">Arakaki et al., 2011</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Divergence times were estimated using a lognormal, relaxed (uncorrelated) molecular clock as implemented in BEAST v 1.8.0 (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Drummond et al., 2012</a>
    ) by analysing the combined plastid data without gaps. For Sites we used: substitution model GTR with base frequencies ‘Estimated’ and the site heterogeneity model set to ‘Gamma + Invariant sites’. For Trees we used Tree prior speciation with ‘Yule Process’. Uclad mean was set to Normal prior with standard deviation of 10.
   </p>
   <p>
    We ran the Markov Chain twice for 10
    <sup>
     7
    </sup>
    generations on unpartitioned data, sampling every 1000th generation. The first 2500 samples were discarded as burn-in as suggested by an examination of the parameters with Tracer v. 1.5 (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Rambaut and</a>

    2.5. Biogeographical analysis with RASP (reconstruct ancestral state in phylogenies)
   </h3>
   <p>
    The biogeographical analysis was performed with RASP 3.1 (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Yu</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">et al., 2015</a>
    ) using a condensed tree from the Bayesian analysis. Distributions of species were coded with A = Southern Africa, B = Australasia (Australia and New Zealand), C = North and South America, D = Eurasia, including the Mediterranean coast of North Africa and Spain to Iran, E = East Africa (
    <a href="#block-3-0">Table 3</a>
    ). For all species we coded the entire distribution area of the species for the terminals included in the tree. In case of the several accessions of widespread species, the actual place of origin of the sample was used. For the downloaded
    <i>
     Aizoon canariense
    </i>
    (2) and
    <i>
     Amaranthus spinosus
    </i>
    , the origin was unknown and therefore the entire known distribution for the species was coded for these accessions. A Bayesian Binary MCMC analysis with standard “Gamma” variation was conducted with a maximum distribution of four regions from the five coded areas allowed per node. All other settings were in the default mode.

    2.6. Ancestral character reconstruction of expanding keels
   </h3>
   <p>
    Morphological information was extracted from the literature (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 1988, 2001</a>
    ), from herbarium specimens at BOL and NBG as well as from field records made over several seasons. We used the consensus tree from BI for the ancestral reconstruction of characters, with Fitch parsimony as implemented in the Ancestral State Reconstruction Package in Mesquite Version 2.72 (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Maddison and Maddison, 2009</a>
    ). Characters were treated as unordered. We reconstructed the evolution of expanding keels in the fruits, since this feature is instrumental in pushing open the valves of the fruits after rain in hygrochastic capsules. We recognized three states: Expanding keels absent (0) (
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    ;
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 2001</a>

    3.1. Phylogenetic reconstruction
   </h3>
   <p>
    Altogether, 19 sequences were missing from the Aizoaceae, through problems in amplification of DNA from herbarium specimens or unavailability of DNA material (
    <a href="#block-3-0">Table 3</a>
    ). In total we included 445 sequences, of which 70 were downloaded from Genbank and 375 were new (
    <a href="#block-3-0">Table 3</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Maximum likelihood (Fig. S1) and Bayesian analyses (
    <a href="#block-8-0">Fig. 2</a>
    ) produced very similar trees. Minor differences between the two analyses involved relationships between closely related species and were not strongly supported. We therefore only display the Bayesian tree (
    <a href="#block-8-0">Fig. 2</a>
    ).

   <h4>
    3.1.1. Polyphyly of Aizooidae
   </h4>
   <p>
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    is not part of the Aizooidae, but is sister to the Mesembryanthemoideae + Ruschioideae (PP = 0.99,
    <a href="#block-8-0">Fig. 2</a>
    ). All eight accessions of the six species of
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    form a highly supported clade (PP = 1.00), within which the three collections of
    <i>
     Acrosanthes teretifolia
    </i>
    resolve in a subclade. In an additional BI analysis, the one accession of “
    <i>
     Acrosanthes teretifolia
    </i>
    ” from
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak</a>
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="#block-13-0">et al. (2003)</a>
    was included and was sister to
    <i>
     Aizoon sarmentosum
    </i>
    (results not shown). This extraction (LHMS 214 of SANBI) was said to have Goldblatt &amp; Manning 11664 (MO) as a voucher. However, this collection belongs to
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    (
    <a href="http://www.tropicos.org/Specimen/1587195">http://www.tropicos.org/Specimen/1587195</a>
    ). Thus, we believe that details of the voucher and the extraction were mixed up.

   <h4>
    3.1.2. Monophyly and relationships among genera of Aizooidae
   </h4>
   <p>
    The Aizooidae (excluding
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    ) consists of major clades A and B (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Fig. 1</a>
    ). Relationships among genera of the Aizooidae are similar to those found previously (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al., 2003</a>
    ), where
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    &amp;
    <i>
     Gunniopsis
    </i>
    (clade B) are sister to
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    (clade A). A novel finding is that
    <i>
     Aizoantheum hispanicum
    </i>
    (L.) H.E. K. Hartmann, which occurs in Eurasia, is sister to
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    +
    <i>
     Gunniopsis
    </i>
    (clade B), whereas the African species of
    <i>
     Aizoantheum
    </i>
    are sister to
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    (clade A).
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition, the increased sampling reveals that several other genera are not monophyletic.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    is nested within one of several clades of
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     P. sericeus
    </i>
    is more closely related to members of
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    than to the other
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    All species of
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    form a clade (PP = 1.00) that is nested within a grade of well-supported clades along with members of
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    is monophyletic, except for
    <i>
     T. schenckii
    </i>
    , which is sister to the two species of
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    of the Sesuvioideae (PP = 1.00).
   </p>
   <h3>
    3.2. Estimation of ages
   </h3>
   <p>
    Ages for the major clades in the Aizoaceae are given in
    <a href="#block-7-0">Table 4</a>
    (chronogram Fig. S2). The Aizoaceae have a mean age of 41.5 My, which falls within the Eocene (38–55 My).
   </p>
   <p>
    The major evolutionary lineages within the Aizoaceae diverged in the Oligocene:
   </p>
   <ol style="list-style-type: none">
    <li>
     Diversification of the Aizooidae began in the early Oligocene
     <math>
      \pm 35.0
     </math>
     My. The Eurasian - southern hemisphere Aizooidae (clade B) diverged since the late Oligocene (
     <math>
      \pm 27.5
     </math>
     My), followed closely by the African clade (A) of the Aizooidae, which diversified since the early Miocene (
     <math>
      \pm 22.2
     </math>
     My).
    </li>
    <li>
     The split between
     <i>
      Acrosanthes
     </i>
     and subfamilies Mesembryanthemoideae &amp; Ruschioideae dates to the early Oligocene (
     <math>
      \pm 36.4
     </math>
     My).
    </li>
    <li>
     In the Sesuvioideae,
     <i>
      Tribulocarpus
     </i>
     &amp;
     <i>
      Tetragonia schenckii
     </i>
     diverged from the other Sesuvioideae in the mid Oligocene (
     <math>
      \pm 29.6
     </math>
     My).
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The disjunctions of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    are more recent: The node subtending
    <i>
     Tetragonia implexicoma
    </i>
    from Australasia and the South American species of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    dates to the late Miocene (
    <math>
     \pm 10.0
    </math>
    My). The split between the Australasian species and the African species of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    is slightly earlier in the mid Miocene (
    <math>
     \pm 17.1
    </math>
    My).
   </p>
   <p>
    Similarly, for
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    , the disjunction between the northern and southern populations of
    <i>
     T. dimorphanthus
    </i>
    is estimated at 7.4 My and is thus fairly recent (between late Miocene and start of Pliocene).
   </p>
   <p>
    However, most species of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    , which are restricted to southern Africa and make up about half of the Aizooidae (
    <a href="#block-2-0">Table 2</a>
    ), have diverged only within the last
    <math>
     \pm 5
    </math>
    My, i.e. since the Pliocene.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also the six species of
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    only diversified since the Pliocene, i.e. in the last
    <math>
     \pm 5.3
    </math>
    My.

   <p>
    (i) Clade A (A1–A4) is endemic to southern Africa, except for
    <i>
     Aizoon canariense
    </i>
    , (from southern Africa, as well as Eurasia). In addition, subclades A1–A3 occupy distinct regions within southern Africa:
   </p>
   <p>
    Clade A2 includes species of
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    from the northern Cape (South Africa) and Namibia, whereas the species of
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    from the Little Karoo and the Eastern Cape constitute a separate clade (clade A3).
   </p>
   <p>
    Clade A1 consists of those species of
    <i>
     Aizoonthemum
    </i>
    which are endemic to the hyper-arid coastal plain of the Namib Desert, from Namibia into Angola.
   </p>
   <p>
    (ii) Clade B, apart from
    <i>
     Aizoonthemum hispanicum
    </i>
    (B1, from Eurasia), is confined to the southern hemisphere (except for the cosmopolitan
    <i>
     Tetragonia tetragonoides
    </i>
    (Pallas) Kuntze), in South America, Australasia and southern Africa.
   </p>
   <p>
    It consists of five major lineages (B1–B5) where the African clade (B5) is nested within clades B2–4, which are endemic to Australasia and South America (Fig. 1).
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    forms three major clades (B3–B5): the southern African clade (B5), an Australasian clade (B4) and a South American/Australasian clade (B3), where the South American species are sister to four accessions of
    <i>
     T. implexicoma
    </i>
    , from New Zealand and Australia.

    All three accessions of
    <i>
     Tetragonia decumbens
    </i>
    , from three distant localities (Cape Town, Eastern Cape (both in South Africa) and Australia), fall in the southern African clade (B5).
   </p>
   <p>
    The cosmopolitan
    <i>
     T. tetragonoides
    </i>
    or “New Zealand spinach” is in the Australasian clade (B2), with later dispersals to South Africa (accession 3).
   </p>
   <p>
    Our reconstruction of the distribution shows southern Africa to be the most likely ancestral area for the Aizooideae s.str. (excluding
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    ) (
    <a href="#block-8-0">Fig. 2</a>
    ). Dispersal from Southern Africa to Eurasia occurred twice, once in
    <i>
     Aizoantherum hispanicum
    </i>
    and (at least) once in
    <i>
     Aizoon canariense
    </i>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Dispersal from Eurasia (46.38%) seems to have given rise to the lineages in the southern hemisphere (clade B), rather than a dispersal event from Africa to Australasia.
   </p>
   <p>
    The ancestral area for
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    is Australasia and not southern Africa, as might have been inferred from the large number of endemic species in southern Africa (
    <a href="#block-2-0">Table 2</a>
    ). Transoceanic dispersal of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    from Australasia occurred three times: one gave rise to the South American lineage of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    , while two separate dispersal-events occurred from Australasia to southern Africa. One involved the widely distributed
    <i>
     Tetragonia tetragonoides
    </i>
    and the second gave rise to the large southern African clade of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    , of which the coastal
    <i>
     T. decumbens
    </i>
    subsequently made its way back to Australasia.

   <h4>
    4.1.1.
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    – an ancient lineage endemic to the fynbos-biome
   </h4>
   <p>
    The Aizoaceae is generally associated with Karoo vegetation, where it forms an important element in the arid parts of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Manning and Goldblatt,</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">2012; Snijman, 2013</a>
    ). Among the four subfamilies of the Aizoaceae all, except the Sesuvioideae, have endemic species in the fynbos biome (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Manning and Goldblatt, 2012; Snijman, 2013</a>
    ). It is therefore remarkable that
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    represents a distinct lineage within the Aizoaceae, which is endemic to fynbos with no representatives in the Karoo.
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    is found from low-lying areas at 160 m to over 2200 m in the mountains of the south-western Cape (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Adamson, 1959a; Manning and Goldblatt, 2012</a>
    ). It lacks any expanding tissue in the fruits (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Adamson, 1959a</a>
    ), which is absent also in all Sesuvioideae as well as in many species in the Aizooideae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 2001</a>
    ). Nevertheless, the fruits of
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    are unique, in that the capsules consist of a parchment-like wall (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Fig.</a>
    1H), which persists in the drying perigone. Once the capsules are mature, they drop off readily. The parchment-like walls are fragile and probably decompose quickly, so that the 1–2 seeds in the capsule may be dispersed further by seed-collecting insects or by rain. A further apomorphic character is the possession of erect, basally attached but almost sessile ovules (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Adamson,</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">1959a</a>
    ), which are pendulous on longer funicles in all other Aizoaceae (e.g.
    <a href="#block-12-0">Adamson, 1955; Hartmann, 2001</a>
    ). Like many plants of the fynbos,
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    has needle-shaped leaves, which are covered with inconspicuous, flattened bladder-like idioblasts. Such idioblasts are thought to be synapomorphic for the Aizoaceae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich and Hartmann, 1988</a>
    ). They can also be greatly reduced in size and number in the Ruschioideae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Ihlenfeldt and</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 1982</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich (1990a)</a>
    suggested the presence of epidermal bladder-hairs as a synapomorphy for the Aizooideae. These bladder-hairs consist of a large terminal cell and a multi-cellular stalk (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich,</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">1990b</a>
    ). He recorded them in
    <i>
     Gunnioopsis papillata
    </i>
    Chinnock,
    <i>
     Tetragonia tetragonoides
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich, 1990a</a>
    ), though not in
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    .
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    shares with the Sesuvioideae and the Aizooideae the characteristic perigone, where the tepals are sepaloid outside and petaloid inside, whereas its sisters, the Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae, have petals of staminodial origin (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich and</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 1988</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Although
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    split from its sisters, the Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae,
    <math>
     \pm 36
    </math>
    My, the species diversified relatively recently (since the Pliocene,
    <math>
     \pm 5
    </math>
    My, Table 4) and this coincides with the radiation of the Ruschieae, where numerous lineages expanded into the fynbos (including
    <i>
     Erepsia

    N.E.Br.,
    <i>

   <h4>
    4.1.2. Phylogenetic relationships within genera
   </h4>
   <p>
    Several genera in the Aizooideae are not monophyletic. The southern African endemics
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    are nested within
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    .
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    was considered to be well circumscribed, on account of its apically depressed capsules, as opposed to a convex apex in
    <i>
     Aizoantherum
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Chinnock, 1983; Hartmann, 2001</a>
    ). However,
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich (1990a)</a>
    noted similar capsules also for most species of
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    and pointed out (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich, 1990b</a>
    ) that there are no clear characters distinguishing the subgenera of
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    or delimiting it from
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    . Thus, the androecial and gynoecial features used by
    <a href="#block-12-0">Adamson (1956)</a>
    to distinguish
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    from
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    are actually shared by these two genera (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich, 1990b</a>
    ). Characteristic for most species in the
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    -clade (incl.
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    ), are the long, often silvery hairs on the leaves, which give their leaves a silvery sheen. Although several species of
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    (such as
    <i>
     G. glandulifera
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     G. africana
    </i>
    ) do not possess “hairs”, these are possibly reduced or modified (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich, 1990b</a>
    ).

    Our phylogeny demonstrates for the first time that
    <i>
     Aizoantherum hispanicum
    </i>
    forms a geographically isolated lineage which is distinct from the southern African species of
    <i>
     Aizoantherum

    as well as from

    African species of
    <i>
     Aizoon

    were distinguished from
    <i>
     Aizoon

    by differences in fruits (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Friedrich, 1957; Chinnock, 1983;</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 2001</a>
    ). The transfer of
    <i>
     Aizoon hispanicum
    </i>
    L. to
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    was based on “literature and some material only” (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann,</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">2001</a>
    ). Capsules of the two lineages of
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    differ markedly: 5-angled in
    <i>
     A. hispanicum
    </i>
    ; globose with 5–10 fine incisions in the southern African species (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Friedrich, 1957; Hartmann,</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">2001</a>
    ). The fruits of
    <i>
     A. hispanicum
    </i>
    also differ in the formation and position of expanding keels from those in
    <i>
     Gunniiopsis

    and
    <i>
     Tetragonia

    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    is monophyletic, except for
    <i>
     T. schenckii
    </i>
    .
    <a href="#block-13-0">Schinz</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">(1894)</a>
    discussed the unusual morphology of
    <i>
     Tetragonia schenckii
    </i>
    and tentatively placed it in
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    . Later he moved it to the monotypic
    <i>
     Anisostigma
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Schinz, 1897</a>
    ), currently recognized as a subgenus of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Adamson, 1955; Hartmann, 2001</a>
    ).
    <i>
     Tetragonia schenckii
    </i>
    is endemic to Namibia and forms woody shrubs to 2 m tall, with slightly succulent leaves and 3- to 4-winged fruits. According to our results it has no close relationship to the other species of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    , but is sister to
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    , which was also treated as a subgenus of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    by
    <a href="#block-12-0">Adamson (1955)</a>
    . However, most authors recognized
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    as a distinct genus on account of its flowers in terminal capitula, perianth with a distinct tube, single 2-lobed style, and spiny compound fruits (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich and</a>

    (Thulin) Thulin &amp; Liede (

    (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Adamson,</a>

    and

    Clearly there is a need for extensive realignment within the subfamily and this will follow in a subsequent paper.

   <h4>
    4.2.1. Age of the Aizooideae
   </h4>
   <p>
    The Aizoaceae dates back to the Eocene at 41.5 My, with its major lineages originating between the end of the Eocene and the Oligocene (
    <a href="#block-7-0">Table 4</a>
    ). This agrees with estimates by
    <a href="#block-12-0">Arakaki</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">et al. (2011)</a>
    . These clades arose after the peak in global temperatures around 50 My (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Zachos et al., 2001</a>
    ) and coincide with the presence of many new open habitats and the development of an arid-adapted vegetation since the early Eocene (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bobe, 2006</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    The initial split of the Aizooideae into two clades, the African clade (clade A) and the Eurasian-Southern hemisphere clade (clade B), dates to the Oligocene. Although the Aizooideae have endemic species on each of the continents where they occur (
    <a href="#block-2-0">Table 2</a>
    ), the largest radiations took place in southern Africa. Here, two of the crown clades,
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    (27 spp.) and the southern African
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    (35 spp.) make up half of the Aizooideae and are fairly young lineages that diversified since the Pliocene (last 5 My). Although the radiations of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    in South America (10 spp.) and Australasia (14 spp.) are of a similar age (
    <math>
     \pm 10
    </math>
    My), they are markedly smaller. Specialization to seasonal aridity subsequent to climate change, is thought to have led to the Late Miocene radiation of clades in the succulent Karoo (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Ihlenfeldt, 1994; Klak et al., 2004; Verboom et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">2009; Linder, 2014</a>
    ). Further reasons, include the unique climatic regime and special properties of the soils of the succulent Karoo (southern Africa), where the highest diversity in the Aizooideae occurs (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al., 2015</a>
    ). This area is characterized by mild, oceanic- and fog-ameliorated conditions, combined with low but predictable rainfall mainly received in winter with periodic droughts. This combination allows for regular germination and space for seedling recruitment and is thought to contribute to the exceptionally high diversity in this area (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Cowling and</a>
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hilton-</a>
    Taylor, 1999). In addition, soils in the northern part of the succulent Karoo show an exceptionally high diversity and spatial variability in both physical and chemical properties, possessing special features, which influence the availability of water and may be important in governing biodiversity (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Francis et al., 2007</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    The radiations of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    in southern Africa are contemporaneous with the diversification of the “core” Ruschioideae and with several other major succulent lineages such as the cacti (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Arakaki et al., 2011</a>
    ), succulent
    <i>
     Euphorbia
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bruyns</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">et al., 2011</a>
    ), the stapeliads (Apocynaceae;
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bruyns et al., 2014a</a>
    ) and
    <i>
     Ceropegia
    </i>
    (incl.
    <i>
     Brachystelma
    </i>
    ; Apocynaceae;
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bruyns et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">2015</a>
    ). Within southern Africa, the much smaller radiation of the Aizooideae compared to the
    <math>
     \pm 1500
    </math>
    species of the “core” Ruschioideae (that arose over a similar time interval), supports the hypothesis that certain “key innovations”, such as the shift from a flat to a trigonous leaf (in cross-section), the evolution of wide band tracheids and of highly specialized hygrochastic capsules, facilitated the spectacular radiation of the “core” Ruschioideae (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al., 2004</a>
    ) and that these were absent in the Aizooideae.

   <h4>
    4.2.2. Disjunct distributions in Africa
   </h4>
   <p>
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    is of considerable interest in the history of African arid regions, since it shows a disjunct distribution between Namibia and north-eastern Africa (e.g. Verdouw, 1969; Thulin, 1994), with
    <i>
     T. dimorphanthus
    </i>
    (Pax) S.Moore, currently recognized as a paraphyletic species occurring in both areas (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Thulin et al., 2012</a>
    ). On account of the genetic difference between the populations, this disjunction is thought to be comparatively old (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Thulin et al., 2012</a>
    ), possibly dating back to the early Miocene (22 My) at which time an “arid corridor” may have linked the two areas (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Caujapé-</a>
    Castells
    <a href="#block-12-0">et al., 2001</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    The lineage made up of
    <i>
     Tetragonia schenckii
    </i>
    &amp;
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    is relatively ancient. With the incorporation of
    <i>
     T. schenckii
    </i>
    into
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    (based on the shared synapomorphies, see Section
    <a href="#block-7-0">4.1.2</a>
    . above),
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    would have one endemic species each in Namibia (
    <i>
     T. schenckii
    </i>
    ) and Somalia (
    <i>
     T. retusus
    </i>
    ;
    <a href="#block-13-0">Thulin et al.,</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">2012</a>
    ). Such disjunct distributions may be the remnants of a wider distribution for this lineage.
    <a href="#block-12-0">Jürgens (1997)</a>
    suggested that an arid African flora may exist, which is centred in the Horn of Africa with a secondary centre in south-western Africa and that an arid corridor may have linked the two regions during the Miocene (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Caujapé-
     <a href="#block-12-0">
      Castells</a>
     et al., 2001
    </a>
    ), as well as during the Pleistocene (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bellstedt</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">et al., 2008; Schrire et al., 2009</a>
    ). The existence of an ancient “Arid Flora” is supported by patterns of disjunction in other succulent lineages such as
    <i>
     Sesamothamnus
    </i>
    (Pedaliaceae,
    <a href="#block-12-0">Ihlenfeldt, 1967</a>
    ), the Didiereaceae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Arakaki et al., 2011</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bruyns et al., 2014b</a>
    ) and in certain subgenera of
    <i>
     Euphorbia
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bruyns et al., 2011</a>
    ), but this was not detected in a recent analysis of African floras (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Linder,</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">2014</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Such disjunct distributions were regarded by
    <a href="#block-13-0">Thulin (1994)</a>
    either as Pleistocene relicts or as arising from fairly recent, long-distance dispersals. The disjunction of the north-east African populations and the southern African populations of
    <i>
     T. dimorphanthus
    </i>
    dates to the late Miocene. This relatively old age is supported by the genetic differences between the southern and northern populations, though there is surprisingly little morphological divergence between them (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Thulin et al., 2012</a>
    ). The fruits of this species are spiny and may be adapted to dispersal by animals, as found for many spiny fruits of Pedaliaceae (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Van der Pijl, 1969;</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">Ihlenfeldt, 2010</a>
    ). Animals involved in the dispersal of spiny fruits, which may explain such long-distance dispersal, could also include already extinct animals (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Midgley and Illing, 2009</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <h4>
    4.2.3. Long distance and trans-oceanic dispersal
   </h4>
   <p>
    The major centres for the Aizoaceae are the arid regions of southern Africa, with minor centres in arid Australia and the arid
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="page" data-page-id="11">
   <p>
    Pacific side (west coast) of South America (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich, 1990a</a>
    ;
    <a href="#block-13-0">Taylor,</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">1994</a>
    ). With the exception of the North American endemic
    <i>
     Cypselea
    </i>
    Turpin (Sesuvioideae) and the Australian endemics
    <i>
     Sarcozona
    </i>
    (Ruschioideae) and
    <i>
     Gunniopsis
    </i>
    , all other genera occur in southern Africa (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 2001</a>
    ). We identified Southern Africa as the ancestral area for the Aizooideae and this is also where most endemic species and the greatest diversity occur (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al., 2015</a>
    ). In order to explain the observed disjunctions in the Aizoaceae,
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich</a>
    <a href="#block-12-0">(1990b)</a>
    rejected the possibility that such distributions indicate a Gondwanan connection, but favoured the idea that some widespread species had adapted to long-distance dispersal by seabirds and this led to the wide distribution of the subfamily. Since Africa had separated from the other Gondwanan land-masses already by 100 My (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Scotese et al., 2008</a>
    ), our estimate substantiates the hypothesis of long-distance dispersal, which was also found for the Sesuvioideae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bohley et al., 2015</a>
    ). For the first time our biogeographical analysis lends support to the hypothesis of a trans-oceanic dispersal from Eurasia to Australasia initiating the
    <i>
     Gunniopsis
    </i>
    &amp;
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    clade, rather than a dispersal from southern Africa to Australasia (
    <a href="#block-8-0">Fig. 2</a>
    ). The two independent dispersals from Australasia (one to South America and one to southern Africa) after the diversification of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    began in the early Miocene, must also have taken place by long-distance dispersal.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are only two widespread, salt-adapted, coastal species of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    and both also have vast, trans-oceanic distributions:
    <i>
     Tetragonia tetragonoides
    </i>
    (worldwide) and
    <i>
     T. decumbens
    </i>
    (southern Africa--Australasia). Although dispersal by seabirds or seawater may be possible, the introduction of these species by humans is also conceivable. The latter scenario may apply to the edible
    <i>
     T. tetragonoides
    </i>
    , which could have been spread from Australasia to other continents by the early explorers and is now a cosmopolitan weed (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Holm et al., 1979</a>
    : 360). Intercontinental dispersal of salt-adapted species by rafting has occurred frequently in other angiosperm families (Asteraceae,
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bergh and Linder, 2009</a>
    ; Amaranthaceae,
    <a href="#block-12-0">Kadereit et al., 2005, 2006</a>
    ) and may have happened here too.
   </p>
   <h3>
    4.3. Evolution of fruits
   </h3>
   <h4>
    4.3.1. Hygrochastic capsules with expanding tissue
   </h4>
   <p>
    In the Aizoaceae most fruits are capsules and many of them are hygrochastic. In addition, many have capsules without expanding tissue (xerochastic capsules) or the fruits are nut-like, stiffly winged or horned nuts and occasionally even drupes (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Fig. 1</a>
    ). Expanding keels, which are responsible for the hygrochastic function, are absent in the Sesuvioideae, but are present in all other subfamilies. If we assume a single origin for expanding keels (supported by their similar structure,
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich, 1990a</a>
    ), these would have originated after the split of the Sesuvioideae from the remainder of the Aizoaceae and were then reduced or lost repeatedly in the family.
   </p>
   <p>
    Capsules with fully functional expanding keels are present in both Clades A and B of the Aizooideae (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Fig. 1</a>
    ). In Clade A, only
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    has fully functional expanding keels, whereas they are much shortened in
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    and even further reduced in
    <i>
     Galenia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Plinthus
    </i>
    , whose fruits open at most slightly (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Bittrich, 1990b</a>
    ). In Clade B,
    <i>
     Aizoon
    </i>
    has fully functional expanding keels, whereas these are absent in
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    . Unique for
    <i>
     Gunniopsis
    </i>
    is that the expanding keels are septicidal, which means that the expanding tissue is lateral on the valves (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Chinnock, 1983</a>
    ), whereas it is in a medial position in all other Aizoaceae with expanding keels. The different position of the expanding keels in
    <i>
     Gunniopsis
    </i>
    may not necessarily indicate a separate origin, since expanding tissue generally can be found on different parts of the capsule also in the Ruschioideae, where it can extend beyond the keels (e.g. expanding sheets,
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 1988</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Reduction in or loss of expanding tissue occasionally occurred also in the Ruschioideae (e.g. most species in the Apatiesieae,
    <i>
     Stoeberia gigas
    </i>
    Dinter &amp; Schwantes) and Mesembryanthemoideae (e.g.
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemum nucifer
    </i>
    (Ihlenf. &amp; Bittrich) Klak). Although it remains ambiguous how often expanding tissue has evolved (
    <a href="#block-9-0">Fig. 3</a>
    ), it has been lost several times independently in different lineages in the Aizooideae and in the Aizoaceae as a whole. It is noteworthy that this tissue is not regained once loss or reduction has occurred (
    <a href="#block-9-0">Fig. 3</a>
    ). We therefore favour Bittrich's hypothesis of a single origin for the evolution of expanding tissue.
   </p>
   <h4>
    4.3.2. Capsules and fruits without expanding tissue
   </h4>
   <p>
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    are the two genera in the Aizooideae, which have fruits without any expanding tissue. We discussed above (see Section
    <a href="#block-7-0">4.1.1</a>
    .) the unique, thin-walled, parchment-like capsules of
    <i>
     Acrosanthes
    </i>
    . In
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-6-0">Fig.</a>
    1A–D) and
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    (Sesuvioideae) the fruits are woody, winged or horned nuts, compound and spiny or sometimes drupes. This led to the notion that the two genera were closely allied and, consequently, to them being placed together in the Tetragonioideae (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 2001</a>
    ). Other species with winged nuts were also placed in
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Schinz, 1894; Adamson, 1955; Thulin, 1993</a>
    ). Later this feature was found not to indicate a close relationship (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Klak et al., 2003;</a>
    <a href="#block-13-0">Thulin et al., 2012</a>
    ) and winged nuts had developed independently in both the Aizooideae and the Sesuvioideae. The position of
    <i>
     Tetragonia schenckii
    </i>
    (also with winged nuts) as sister to
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    now contributes a further species to this clade with such fruit.
   </p>
   <p>
    The early diverging lineages, the Sesuvioideae and Aizooideae, include a wide range of different fruit types: circumsessile capsules, winged or variously sculptured nuts, compound, spiny fruits, hygrochastic and xerochastic loculicidal capsules or rarely drupes. This contrasts with the Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae where most species (see exceptions Section 4.3.1 above) have hygrochastic, loculicidal capsules.
   </p>
   <p>
    Different types of fruits imply different strategies of dispersal. In hygrochastic capsules seeds are mainly dispersed by rain, rarely by animals or by wind (
    <a href="#block-12-0">Hartmann, 1991</a>
    ). On the other hand, the winged or spiky fruits of
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Tribulocarpus
    </i>
    are adapted to wind- or animal-dispersal (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Van der Pijl, 1969; Thulin et al., 2012</a>
    ). The higher diversity of fruits in the early-diverging lineages of the Aizoaceae, suggests more strategies of dispersal. This contrasts with the Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae, where the most extensive specialization and diversification occurred with a single strategy of dispersal, achieved mainly by rain (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Parolin, 2006</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <h2>
    5. Conclusions
   </h2>
   <p>
    Our phylogeny is derived from four chloroplast markers used on a sampling of the Aizooideae that is broad in terms of their distributions, their morphological diversity and taxonomic groupings. The Aizooideae are relatively ancient (having been around since the Oligocene), whereas several of its crown clades diversified only since the Pliocene. The major radiations in the Aizooideae coincide with those of the hyperdiverse Ruschieae (Ruschioideae) as well as other African succulent lineages in
    <i>
     Euphorbia
    </i>
    (Euphorbiaceae) and the Ceropogieae (Apocynaceae). Most of the species belong to two major clades: one endemic to southern Africa (except for
    <i>
     Aizoon canariense
    </i>
    also found in Eurasia); a second endemic to Eurasia (1 sp), Australasia, southern Africa and South America (as well as the cosmopolitan
    <i>
     Tetragonia tetragonoides
    </i>
    ). Southern Africa is most likely the ancestral area for the Aizooideae, with an early event of long-distance dispersal to Eurasia. The Australasian lineages of Aizooideae were likely founded by trans-oceanic dispersal from Eurasia, with subsequent dispersals from Australasia giving rise to the South American and African
    <i>
     Tetragonia
    </i>
    .
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="page" data-page-id="12">

    The Aizooideae and several of its genera are not monophyletic. Our results form the basis for re-evaluating the taxonomic value of various morphological features used in the past and have identified new clades for which synapomorphies are needed.
