David Gordon has argued that, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Cannaland in the Little Karoo was the location of a precious natural resource, <i>canna</i>, a plant that produced the trance-inducing qualities needed for Khoikhoi (San) healers to extract sickness or make rain. Narcotic plants were much prized in South Africa so that the Tswana obtained <i>canna</i> from the Khoikhoi, while the Xhosa on the east coast later exchanged coral and copper rings for cannabis.<sup>89</sup> And by the later eighteenth century the Khoikhoi around Swellendam were known to have harvested <i>aloe socotorina</i> to make gum aloes from its leaves, which they sold in Cape Town, with some then exported.<sup>90</sup> During the mid-nineteenth century, Dr W. G. Atherstone recorded medicinal herbal trading—again centred in the Karoo—when Basters (people of mixed white and Khoikhoi descent) traded <i>sceletium</i>. This was a painkiller used by Afrikaners to treat an adult's insomnia or a child's diarrhoea, while coloured people chewed it as a mild narcotic or intoxicant.<sup>91</sup> And herb trading had acquired sufficient importance by 1884 for the <i>South African Medical Journal</i> to refer to the herb dealer as the registered doctor's competitor.<sup>92</sup> At the beginning of the twentieth century, African hawkers from certain tribes in and around Zululand were recorded as being itinerant herb traders, selling the <i>indungula</i> plant (employed for fevers in winter, and to ward off lightning strikes in summer), and the <i>ikatazo</i> plant (whose root was used for colds).<sup>93</sup> By this time, itinerant Indian traders were becoming well established in the herbal medicine trade, while herb stalls could also be found by roadsides in the eastern Cape.<sup>94</sup> African traders from rural areas (predominantly women) continue to sell herbal medicines to urban consumers in open markets to the present day.<sup>95</sup></p>\n", "page": 13, "polygon": [[147.0, 369.0], [1052.0, 369.0], [1052.0, 1165.0], [147.0, 1165.0]], "bbox": [147.0, 369.0, 1052.0, 1165.0], "section_hierarchy": {"1": "/page/0/SectionHeader/1", "2": "/page/12/SectionHeader/4"}, "images": {}, "chunk_id": 181}

But whether this option was theoretical or real in terms of actual historical resources needs to be factored into any cost–benefit analysis.
