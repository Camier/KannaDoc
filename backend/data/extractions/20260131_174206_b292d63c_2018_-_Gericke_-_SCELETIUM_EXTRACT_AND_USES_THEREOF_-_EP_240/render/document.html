    <b>
     [0002]
    </b>
    Plants of the genus
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    are known to contain an alkaloid content including indole alkaloids such as mesembrenol, mesembranol, mesembrine and mesembranone, the chemical formulae of which are described in US Patent No 6,288,104. Plants of the genus
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    are known to vary widely in terms of the total alkaloid content, as well as the chemistry and relative concentrations of individual
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    alkaloids (Gericke, N. and A.M. Viljoen.
    <i>

    - a review update.
    <i>

    </i>
    119 (2008) 653-663). It is reported that mesembrine is the main active ingredient in
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemum tortuosum
    </i>
    , (van Wyk, B.-E., B. van Oudshoorn and N. Gericke 2009.

    </i>
    , 2nd Edition, Briza, Pretoria). (
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemum tortuosum
    </i>
    is a botanical synonym for
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    ). It is reported in US Patent No. 6,288,104 that mesembrine is virtually the only alkaloid present in the leaves 25 of the species
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    . US Patent No 6,288,104 describes mesembrine, mesembrenol and mesembranone as having potent 5-HT uptake inhibitory activity and as being useful in treating mental health conditions such as mild to moderate depression. Mesembrine hydrochloride has previously been reported to be a weak PDE4 inhibitor (Napoleto, M. et al. 2001. Mesembrine is an inhibitor of PDE4 that follows the structure-activity relationship of rolipram.

    It is generally believed that plants of the genus
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    , and extracts thereof, should preferably contain high concentrations of mesembrine to contribute substantially to the known biological activity thereof. For bioactive plant extracts intended for human or animal consumption it is desirable to have a reproducible and stable phytochemical profile for the plant material, and for any extract or pharmaceutical composition produced from that plant material. 35 However, mesembrine has been reported to be unstable under a variety of conditions that can occur while harvesting, drying, and extracting the raw material, as well as during storage and formulation of the extract. Mesembrine has been shown to be unstable under conditions of fermentation, exposure to light, exposure to heat, and in an aqueous medium (Patnala, S. and Kanfer, I.

    The applicant has found that it is able to produce a novel composition which may be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition or a dietary supplement, which includes as an active ingredient an extract of a plant of the family
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemaceae
    </i>
    with mesembrenol and mesembrenone as the two major alkaloids present and having low or trace amounts of mesembrine and a selected minimum amount of mesembranol. The problems associated with stability are alleviated and surprisingly, notwithstanding the low mesembrine content, compositions in accordance with the invention, exhibit potent PDE-4 inhibition properties and retain potent serotonin uptake inhibition properties. 45

    invention, it is believed that some drugs of abuse have a modulatory effect on neurogenesis, which is associated with depression, anxiety and other mood disorders, as well as deficits in cognition, learning, and memory. Moreover, mood disorders are causative and/or risk factors for substance abuse, and substance abuse (as self-medication) is a common behavioral symptom of mood disorders. Thus, substance abuse and mood disorders may reinforce each other, rendering patients suffering from both conditions non-responsive to treatment. Thus, the composition of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be used to treat patients suffering from substance abuse and/or mood disorders.

For example, the patient suffers from chronic pain and is prescribed one or more opiate/opioid medications; and/or suffers from ADD, ADHD, or a related disorder, and is prescribed a psychostimulant, such as ritalin, dexedrine, adderall, or a similar medication which inhibits neurogenesis. Without being bound by any particular theory, and offered to improve understanding of the invention, it is believed that such medications can exert a modulatory effect on neurogenesis, leading to depression, anxiety and other mood disorders, as well as deficits in cognition, learning, and memory. Thus, for example, the composition of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be administered to a patient who is currently or has recently been prescribed a medication that exerts a modulatory effect on neurogenesis, in order to treat depression, anxiety, and/or other mood disorders, and/or to improve cognition.

    Further, identifying a patient in need of neurogenesis modulation comprises selecting a population or sub-population of patients, or an individual patient, that is more amenable to treatment and/or less susceptible to side effects than other patients having the same disease or condition. Or, identifying a patient amenable to treatment with the composition of the invention comprises identifying a patient who has been exposed to a factor known to enhance neurogenesis, including but not limited to, exercise, hormones or other endogenous factors, and drugs taken as part of a pre-existing treatment regimen. Or, a sub-population of patients is identified as being more amenable to neurogenesis modulation with the composition of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof by taking a cell or tissue sample from prospective patients, isolating and culturing neural cells from the sample, and determining the effect of the compound on the degree or nature of neurogenesis of the cells, thereby allowing selection of patients for which the therapeutic agent has a substantial effect on neurogenesis. Advantageously, the selection of a patient or population of patients in need of or amenable to treatment with the composition of the invention according to the invention allows more effective treatment of the disease or condition targeted for treatment.

    Alternatively, the patient has suffered a CNS insult, such as a CNS lesion, a seizure (e.g., electroconvulsive seizure treatment; epileptic seizures), radiation, chemotherapy and/or stroke or other ischemic injury. Without being bound by any particular theory, and offered to improve understanding of the invention, it is believed that some CNS insults/injuries leads to increased proliferation of neural stem cells, but that the resulting neural cells form aberrant connections which can lead to impaired CNS function and/or diseases, such as temporal lobe epilepsy. A therapeutically effective amount of the composition of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be administered to a patient who has suffered, or is at risk of suffering, a CNS insult or injury to stimulate neurogenesis. Advantageously, stimulation of the differentiation of neural stem cells with the composition of the invention, optionally in combination with one or more other neurogenic agents, activates signalling pathways necessary for progenitor cells to effectively migrate and incorporate into existing neural networks or to block inappropriate proliferation.

    Additionally, the invention finds utility in the application of the composition of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to treat a subject or patient for a condition due to the anti-neurogenic effects of an opiate or opioid based analgesic. The administration of an opiate or opioid based analgesic, such as an opiate like morphine or other opioid receptor agonists, to a subject or patient, results in a decrease in, or inhibition of, neurogenesis. The administration of the composition of the invention with an opiate or opioid based analgesic would reduce the anti-neurogenic effect. One non-limiting example is administration of such a combination with an opioid receptor agonist after surgery (such as for treating post-operative pain).

    [0054] Alternatively, the invention finds utility in a method to treat or prevent decreases in, or inhibition of, neurogenesis in other cases involving use of an opioid receptor agonist, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the composition of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as described herein. Non-limiting examples include cases involving an opioid receptor agonist, which decreases or inhibits neurogenesis, and drug addiction, drug rehabilitation, and/or prevention of relapse into addiction. The opioid receptor agonist may be morphine, opium or another opiate.
   </p>
   <p>
    [0055] The invention also finds utility in a method to treat a cell, tissue, or subject which is exhibiting decreased neurogenesis or increased neurodegeneration. In some cases, the cell, tissue, or subject is, or has been, subjected to, or contacted with, an agent that decreases or inhibits neurogenesis. One non-limiting example is a human subject that has been administered morphine or other agent which decreases or inhibits neurogenesis. Non-limiting examples of other agents include opiates and opioid receptor agonists, such as mu receptor subtype agonists, that inhibit or decrease neurogenesis.
   </p>
   <p>
    [0056] Thus the composition of the invention may be used to treat subjects having, or diagnosed with, depression or other withdrawal symptoms from morphine or other agents which decrease or inhibit neurogenesis. This is distinct from the treatment of subjects having, or diagnosed with, depression independent of an opiate, such as that of a psychiatric nature, as disclosed herein. In further embodiments, the method may be used to treat a subject with one or more chemical addictions or dependencies, such as with morphine or other opiates, where the addiction or dependency is ameliorated or alleviated by an increase in neurogenesis.
   </p>
   <p>
    [0057] The amount of the composition of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be such that it results in a measurable relief of a disease condition like those described herein. As a non-limiting example, an improvement in the Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D) score for depression may be used to determine (such as quantitatively) or detect (such as qualitatively) a measurable level of improvement in the depression of a subject.

    [0066] The advantages of a dual PDE4 and 5-HT uptake inhibition mechanisms of action include the possibility of using a lower dose to achieve the same therapeutic objective in conditions that respond to both a 5-HT uptake inhibitor, as well as a PDE4 inhibitor, such as conditions that modulate neurogenesis. The use of lower doses of the dual acting the composition of the invention can be expected to have a reduced side-effect profile than single-action pharmaceuticals or medicaments, such as a reduction in the loss of libido commonly found with in 5-HT uptake inhibitors; and a reduction in the nausea and vomiting found with PDE4 inhibitors. The dual action of the pharmaceutical or medicament can be an advantage by reducing the number of medications that have to be taken where there is a relevant co-morbidity. For example arthritis together with depression, Alzheimers together with depression.

    grows best under intensive and well-managed horticultural conditions. The most reliable biomass production is achieved under conditions of 20-60 % shade, with plants grown in individual bags. The soil medium needs to be sterilised for each growing season, and plants correctly spaced to allow for sufficient aeration and to prevent plant diseases. Plants that show any sign of infection must be removed immediately.

    [0076] Watering regimens are adjusted on a case-by-case basis to achieve maximal biomass production with plant disease prevention. Nutrients are applied by conventional fertigation, and the water supply to the plants must be filtered and treated with ultravioltet light to minimise exposure to plant pathogens via the water source. Sceletium grows best under shade conditions in individual bags so that cultural practices can be more carefully controlled.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Harvesting and Drying
   </h3>
   <p>
    [0077] Plants are typically harvested from October to December. Irrigation is curtailed to allow for a lower moisture content in the plant to facilitate drying. Harvesting is done by hand by workers wearing suitable protective gloves. Only the aerial parts of the plant are harvested without any flowers or seed capsules. The fresh biomass is first washed in clean water and allowed to dry in the air. It is crushed using rollers and put onto shallow mesh-lined trays which are stacked and placed in a conventional commercial air drying facility designed for drying fruit. The material is dried at 55 °C for 48 hours with a relative humidity of 30%, to a final moisture content of less than 10%.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Extraction
   </h3>
   <p>
    [0078] Dry above-ground plant material is milled using a conventional industrial milling machine, for example a hammer mill, with the mesh size adjusted to achieve a particle size preferably greater than 85 microns and less than or equal to 3mm.
   </p>
   <p>
    [0079] The milled powder is added to an aqueous, or aqueous-ethanolic solution, most preferably consisting of not less than 70% ethanol, in a suitably sized stainless steel container with an electric stirrer. The ratio of raw material to extraction liquid is preferably between 1 : 5 to 1 : 7 by weight. The temperature is preferably kept at between 25 °C - 50 °C. The mixture is stirred slowly and continuously for 24 hours, then filtered through a suitable commercial filter of sufficient fineness to exclude particulate matter. The filtrate is spray-dried using a conventional spray-drier onto suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as lactose monohydrate. The amount of pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is adjusted by those skilled in the art to ensure a final total alkaloid content of 0.4% Figure 1 shows the typical CG-MS chromatogram of the extract with three prominent alkaloid peaks for mesembrenol, mesembranone and mesembrenone and a smaller peak for mesembrine. The CG-MS chromatogram has been annotated to show the MS spectra and chemical structures of mesembrenol, mesembranol, mesembrine and mesembrenone.
   </p>
   <p>
    [0080] Using raw material of the specific high-mesembrenol, low-mesembrine selection of Sceletium already described herein, the extract profile could be produced by those skilled in the art using other extraction technologies and processes, including but not limited to, vacuum drying of filtrate, supercritical CO

    (Endcotts Filters LTD, London). A mass of 5 g of the powder is weighed and transferred to a conical flask. A volume of 60 mL, 0.5 N sulphuric acid (AR grade, Merck LTD) is then added to the mixture which is shaken manually to ensure that the pulverized plant material is in suspension and then left undisturbed for 15 min. The mixture is then filtered into a 250 mL separating funnel using MN 615. 125 mm filter paper (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). A volume of 30 mL of 20% (v/v) ammonia (AR grade, Merck LTD) solution is added to the contents of the separating funnel and gently swirled. Universal litmus paper (pH-Fix, 0-14, Macherey-Nagel) is used in this step to ensure that the pH of the flask is greater than 7 (basic).

    Alkaloids are extracted from the basic mixture (prepared above) using AR grade dichloromethane (DCM) from Merck LTD. A volume of 35 mL, DCM is added to the flask which is swirled gently. The mixture is allowed to settle and the lower DCM layer is filtered into round-bottomed flasks using MN 615. 125 mm filter paper. The liquid-liquid extraction is carried out twice and the two DCM filtrates are combined and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (Büchi rotavapor R-200, Switzerland) at 40 °C, to a volume of approximately 2 mL. The concentrated extract is transferred into weighed 8.0 mL glass vials and then placed in a vacuum oven (Vismara srl scientific equipment-technical service, model Vo 65) at 40 °C and 0.2 bar. The mass of the dry alkaloid extract is calculated and the percentage yield determined using the formula below.

    The dried alkaloids extracts are re-suspended in methanol at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Approximately 20 microliter of each sample is transferred to Agilent vials. These samples are analysed using a GC-MS system (Agilent 6890N GC). Splitless injection (2

    m film thickness); the oven temperature program starts at 60 °C, rising to 255 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and is held for 15 min. Helium is used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Spectra are obtained on electron impact at 70 eV, scanning from 35 to 550 m/z. The percentage area of each compound is calculated from the integrated peak area on the FID detector. Compound identifications are performed by comparing their mass spectra and the retention indices with authentic standards. A typical CG-MS chromatogram and retention times of the 4 key alkaloids in the raw material selected for the composition of the invention are shown in Figure 2.

   </h3>
   <p>
    <b>
     [0084]
    </b>
    A mass of 5 g of the dry powdered extract is weighed and transferred to a conical flask. A volume of 60 mL, 0.5 N sulphuric acid (AR grade, Merck LTD) is then added to the mixture which is shaken manually to ensure that the extract is in suspension and then left undisturbed for 15 min. The mixture is then filtered into a 250 mL separating funnel using MN 615. 125 mm filter paper (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). A volume of 30 mL of 20% (v/v) ammonia (AR grade, Merck LTD) solution is added to the contents of the separating funnel and gently swirled. Universal litmus paper (pH-Fix, 0-14, Macherey-Nagel) is used in this step to ensure that the pH of the flask is greater than 7 (basic).

    Alkaloids are extracted from the basic mixture (prepared above) using AR grade dichloromethane (DCM) from Merck LTD. A volume of 35 mL, DCM is added to the flask which is swirled gently. The mixture is allowed to settle and the lower DCM layer is filtered into round-bottomed flasks using MN 615. 125 mm filter paper. The liquid-liquid extraction is carried out twice and the two DCM filtrates are combined and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (Büchi rotavapor R-200, Switzerland) at 40 °C, to a volume of approximately 2 mL. The concentrated extract are transferred into weighed 8.0 mL glass vials and then placed in a vacuum oven (Vismara srl scientific equipment-technical service, model Vo 65) at 40 °C and 0.2 bar. The mass of the dry alkaloid extract is calculated and the percentage yield determined using the formula below.

The Hill coefficient is a measure of the slope of the dose-response curve; when the coefficient is in the region of 1.0, the interaction at the binding site is likely to be competitive.

    Accordingly, the Applicants have found that a composition that includes as an active ingredient an extract of a plant of the family Mesembryanthemaceae with mesembrenol and mesembrenone as the major alkaloids present, and whilst having low or trace amounts of mesembrine and selected amounts of mesembranol, shows remarkable serotonin uptake and PDE4 inhibition. This is particularly advantageous in that the composition lends itself to a wider use for medicinal purposes including in formulations for treating inflammatory conditions, and formulations for treating conditions with deficits in learning and memory. A further advantage of the above combination is the dual action of the composition which makes it suitable to treat conditions wherein the conditions of a patient are responsive to PDE4 inhibition, such as chronic inflammatory diseases where anxiety and depression are a common feature. Still a further benefit is that a low-mesembrine composition avoids the poor stability issues associated with mesembrine.
