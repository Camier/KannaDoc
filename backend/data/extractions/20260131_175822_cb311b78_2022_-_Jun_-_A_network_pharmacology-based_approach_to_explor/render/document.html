     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    (SCT) has been utilized medicinally by indigenous Koi-San people purportedly for mood elevation. SCT extracts are reported to be neuroprotective and have efficacy in improving cognition. However, it is still unclear which of the pharmacological mechanisms of SCT contribute to the therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, this study investigated two aspects—firstly, the abilities of neuroprotective sub-fractions from SCT on scavenging radicals, inhibiting some usual targets relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD), and secondly utilizing the network pharmacology related methods to search probable mechanisms using Surflex-Dock program to show the key targets and corresponding SCT constituents. The results indicated sub-fractions from SCT could scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR). Furthermore, the results of gene ontology and docking analyses indicated the key targets involved in the probable treatment of AD or PD might be AChE, MAO-B, NMDAR subunit2B (GluN2B-NMDAR), adenosine A
    <sub>
     2A
    </sub>
    receptor and cannabinoid receptor 2, and the corresponding constituents in
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    might be N-trans-feruloyl-3-methyldopamine, dihydrojoubertiamine and other mesembrine type alkaloids. In summary, this study has provided new evidence for the therapeutic potential of SCT in the treatment of AD or PD, as well as the key targets and notable constituents in SCT. Therefore, we propose SCT could be a natural chemical resource for lead compounds in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

    <a href="#block-17-0">5</a>
    ,
    <a href="#block-17-0">6</a>
    ]. Cognition deficit is a predominantly general symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in some cases of Parkinson's diseases (PD)—hence it is postulated that neurodegenerative disorders that could be treated by compounds that possess neuroprotective effects [
    <a href="#block-17-0">7</a>
    –
    <a href="#block-18-0">12</a>
    ]. Considering that there are certain neuroprotective constituents in SCT, which are reported to have the therapeutic potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, there is a need to investigate the probable mechanisms that contribute to the possible treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, especially in AD or PD with cognitive impairments.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Network pharmacology” (NP) methods have been usually applied in this form of research to access primary mechanisms of certain traditional Chinese medicines formula according to their traditional indications [
    <a href="#block-18-0">13</a>
    –
    <a href="#block-18-0">16</a>
    ]. Some studies have also used NP to explore the possible novel indications for complicated Chinese traditional medicines [
    <a href="#block-18-0">17</a>
    ,
    <a href="#block-18-0">18</a>
    ]. Application of NP could be further understood based on the published report by Fang JS et al who proposed and deciphered mechanism of action for some of the most widely studied medicinal herbs used in the treatment of AD [
    <a href="#block-18-0">19</a>
    ].
   </p>
   <p>
    Our previous study [
    <a href="#block-18-0">20</a>
    ] has showed the neuroprotective sub-fractions and possible neuroprotective constituents (
    <a href="#block-2-0">Fig 1</a>
    ) in the neuroprotective sub-fractions extracted from SCT. The petroleum ether and ethyl acetate fractions were confirmed to possess neuroprotective efficacy, been further separated by silica gel column to obtain sub-fractions tested by cell experiments. Furthermore, natural products generally consist of various and diverse active constituents depending on the extraction process [
    <a href="#block-18-0">21</a>
    ], which can lead to neuroprotective fractions that exert neuroprotective effect of SCT and probably caused due to multiple constituents. Thus, it makes such investigations laborious and difficult to decipher the elicited mechanisms. Hence, investigating the possibility of SCT extract for treating neurodegenerative disorders, as an integrated system as applied by traditional Chinese medicine, would provide insight by utilizing NP methods is a logical and scientific approach.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this study, spectrophotometric assays were performed on SCT sub-fractions to assess neuroprotective action related efficacies based on the scavenging radicals, inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidases (MAOs) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR). Subsequently, relevant NP methods and molecular docking were performed to understand the possible mechanisms that provide evidence to correlate the therapeutic potential of SCT in the treatment of AD or PD.
   </p>
   <p>
    Furthermore, it is important to identify the key targets, and the corresponding constituents in neuroprotective sub-fractions involved in the probable treatment of AD or PD [
    <a href="#block-17-0">2</a>

    <a href="#block-17-0">4</a>

    Whole cell patch clamp
   </h4>
   <p>
    To investigate the effect of two sub-fractions from SCT on the NMDAR mediated current, whole cell patch clamp was used to the record of NMDAR current by an amplifier (EPC-10, HEKA, Germany). Before recording, a negative pressure was exerted on the hippocampal neuron's surface through microelectrode and formed a GΩ seal resistance, then the membrane potential was kept in -70 mV. The hippocampal neurons were exposed to NMDA (100 μM), Glycine (10 μM) and samples in different concentrations or D-2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-AP5) (100 μM).
   </p>
   <p>
    NMDA (100 μM) and Glycine (10 μM) were used to activate the NMDA current. D-AP5, a NMDAR inhibitor, was used as a positive control. The current signals were recorded by the amplifier under a Gap-free mode and stored in PatchMaster software (HEKA, Germany).
   </p>
   <p>
    Recording was allowed to start at least 5 min after the rupture of patch membrane to ensure stabilization of the intracellular milieu. Neurons that showed unstable or large (more than ~ 50 pA) holding currents were rejected. The series resistance (&lt; 15 MΩ) and membrane capacitance were compensated and checked regularly during the recording.
   </p>
   <p>
    The inhibition percentage of NMDAR was calculated according to the formula:
    <math>
     (1 - (I_{\text{NMDA}} + \text{Glycine} + \text{Compound} / I_{\text{NMDA}} + \text{Glycine})) \times 100\%

    SCT sub-fractions inhibit MAOs
   </h3>
   <p>
    The results depicted in
    <a href="#block-7-0">Fig 4</a>
    showed, MAO-A selective inhibitor—clorgiline could inhibit the MAOs by about 60% at 50
    <math>
     \mu
    </math>
    M, while MAO-B selective inhibitor—pargyline could inhibit the MAOs by close to 100% at 50
    <math>
     \mu
    </math>
    M. Since the enzyme substrate was tyramine, which could be common enzyme substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B, the enzyme activity of the MAOs we used in this study was considered to be contributed mainly by MAO-B [
    <a href="#block-19-0">45</a>
    ].
   </p>
   <p>
    Except fraction E3, other three active sub-fractions presented more than 40% inhibition percent on MAOs at their highest concentration (1000
    <math>
     \mu
    </math>
    g/mL). The observed inhibition results were regarded as mild.

    SCT sub-fractions inhibit NMDAR
   </h3>
   <p>
    Compared to Zembrin
    <sup>
     ®
    </sup>
    , the more potent neuroprotective P5 and E1 fractions (compared with P6 and E3 in our previous study [
    <a href="#block-18-0">20</a>
    ]) showed potent inhibiting effect on NMDAR-mediated current (
    <a href="#block-8-0">Fig 5</a>
    ). However, this effect is not significant enough to be considered as main mechanism that elicits antidepressant action of SCT.

    Common targets of constituents and neurodegenerative diseases
   </h3>
   <p>
    As indicated in the previous study, the neuroprotective sub-fractions and underlying neuroprotective constituents (structures were shown in
    <a href="#block-2-0">Fig 1</a>
    ) in SCT [
    <a href="#block-18-0">20</a>
    ]. Using Polypharmacology Browser 2, the predictive targets of the constituents from neuroprotective sub-fractions were compared with the targets of neurodegenerative diseases collected from GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. The results of their intersections were showed as
    <a href="#block-9-0">Fig 6</a>
    . Although the percent of overlapping targets in targets of HD was the maximum value (16.67%) among these neurodegenerative diseases, there were only 5 overlapping targets from the intersection.

    GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
   </h4>
   <p>
    The overlapping targets of constituents and AD/PD could enrich in more than 20 terms of biological processes (the terms of which P value &lt; 0.001 were showed as
    <a href="#block-10-0">Fig 7</a>
    ), which mainly involved response to drug (GO:0042493), chemical synaptic transmission (GO:0007268), locomotory behavior (GO:0007626), memory (GO:0007613), learning (GO:0007612, GO:0008542), response to amphetamine (GO:0001975), behavioral response to cocaine (GO:0048148), dopaminergic synaptic transmission (GO:0001963), prepulse inhibition (GO:0060134), etc. These biological processes indicate that the extracts of SCT could exert neurological activities that are helpful to treat cognition deficit and behavioral disorders. The analysis of cellular functions (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Fig 8</a>
    ) showed that these targets mainly included dopamine binding (GO:0035240), dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity (GO:0004952), beta-amyloid binding (GO:0001540), drug binding (GO:0008144), enzyme binding (GO:0019899), etc. Moreover, these overlapping targets are mainly integral component of plasma membrane (GO:0005887), locate on plasma membrane (GO:0016021) and cell surface (GO:0009986), distribute on dendrite (GO:0030425) and axon (GO:0030424) (

   <h4>
    Constituents-targets-disease network diagram
   </h4>
   <p>
    The interactions of the overlapping targets, constituents and their possible targets and targets of AD or PD were fed into cytoscape 3.8.0 software to obtain a constituents-targets-disease network diagram (
    <a href="#block-13-0">Fig 10</a>
    ). In this network diagram, there were 59 nodes and 345 edges, including 23 constituents, 30 targets, 2 diseases, 4 sub-fractions and 1 plant. The result of network analysis (
    <a href="#block-14-0">Table 2</a>
    ) showed that degrees of the targets, of which gene names are SLC6A4, DRD2, ACHE, HTR1A, SLC6A3, HTT, APP, HTR2A, MAOB, BACE1, DRD3, TNF, CNR2, BCHE, DRD1 and GRIN2B, are more than 13 with betweenness centralities more than 0.005 and closeness centralities more than 0.5. The degrees of all constituents in this diagram are equal or greater than 6.

   <h3>
    Key targets in the possible mechanisms of SCT in the treatment of AD or PD
   </h3>
   <p>
    Targets with a greater degree value (more than 13) or enriched in AD or PD KEGG pathway were selected to be docked with constituents from neuroprotective sub-fractions by Surflex-Dock (Total Score results showed as
    <a href="#block-15-0">Fig 11</a>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    The Total Score results indicated that many vital targets involved in AD or PD, for example AChE (ACHE), MAO-B (MAOB), GluN2B-NMDAR (GRIN2B), adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR, ADORA2A) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R, CNR2), have potent predicted binding activity with several SCT constituents. Moreover, SCT constituents as
    <a href="#block-16-0">Fig 12</a>
    showed have higher Total Score with corresponding targets, which indicated that they are more possible to affect the targets to exert neuroprotective efficacy for the treatment of AD or PD.

    . In contrast to the radical scavenging efficacy of SCT extract in the previous study, E3 could present comparative performance on scavenging DPPH radical [
    <a href="#block-19-0">46</a>
    ], which indicated the constituents with antioxidant effect of SCT was enriched in the ethyl acetate sub-fraction. Antioxidative effect is a known mechanism of certain compounds eliciting neuroprotective action [

    ,
    <a href="#block-19-0">47</a>
    –
    <a href="#block-19-0">49</a>
    ]. The results further suggest that SCT has potential to treat neurodegenerative disorders through its antioxidative effect.

    The study also showed moderate inhibiting effect of SCT neuroprotective sub-fractions on AChE, which was more potent than the effect of SCT extract in previous study based on comparing their test concentrations [
    <a href="#block-20-0">50</a>
    ]. The reduction of acetylcholine level in AD patient may cause cognitive and memory impairments [
    <a href="#block-20-0">51</a>
    ]. Hence, AChE may accelerate the progression of AD though promoting the fibration of

    -amyloid [
    <a href="#block-20-0">52</a>
    ]. Scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, produces a blocking of the activity of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and the concomitant appearance of transient cognitive amnesia and electrophysiological changes, which resemble those observed in AD [
    <a href="#block-20-0">53</a>
    ,
    <a href="#block-20-0">54</a>
    ]. There are certain AChE inhibitors approved for AD, for example, donepezil and galanthamine. In fact, some studies had described the neuroprotective effect of AChE inhibitor [
    <a href="#block-18-0">22</a>
    ,
    <a href="#block-18-0">23</a>

    ]. Instead of irreversible inhibitor like selegiline, a reversible MAO-B inhibitor (KDS2010) does not induce compensatory mechanisms in a long term therapy, which further attenuated increased astrocytic GABA levels and astrogliosis, enhanced synaptic transmission, rescued learning and memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice [

NMDAR, an ionotropic glutamate receptor, which constitute a calcium-permeable component of fast excitatory neurotransmission, have been verified to participate neuro-physiologically in many cell signaling pathways resulting in several neurological diseases. An NMDAR inhibitor—esketamine was approved for depressive disorder owing to its rapid antidepressant action. The previous studies showed the potential of SCT on treating depressive disorder [

    Therefore, results of the
    <i>
     in vitro
    </i>
    experiments indicated that there are neuroprotective constituents in SCT could protect neurons to treat neurodegenerative disorders by scavenging radicals, inhibiting AChE, MAOs and NMDAR. Different sub-fractions represented different degrees of influence on AChE, MAOs and NMDAR.
   </p>
   <p>
    Moreover, the neuroprotective sub-fractions of SCT used to assess the potential use to treat AD or PD, was further supported by network pharmacology related methods applied in this study, which was also supported by the observed influence of SCT extract on cognition [
    <a href="#block-17-0">5</a>
    ,
    <a href="#block-17-0">6</a>
    ]. Among several neurodegenerative disorders, the targets of AD or PD from database have most overlapping numbers with the targets predicted by Polypharmacology Browser 2. It is understood that the overlapping targets could be involved in memory, learning and behavior related biological process and enrich in AD and PD corresponding KEGG pathway. The network analysis and Surflex-Dock results have indicated that some key targets, AChE, MAO-B, GluN2B-NMDAR, A2AR and CB2R, can be influenced by SCT in the probable treatment of

    AD or PD, and other constituents SCT or similar moieties of close chemical structures, such as egonie, sceletium A4, dihydrojoubertamine, N-trans-feruloyl-3-methyldopamine, N-methyldihydrojoubertamine and so on, should be concerned to have potential in affecting on corresponding targets (Fig 12).

    In this study, the primary purpose was to explore possible targets of the neuroprotective SCT on neurodegenerative disorders by network pharmacology. According to the identified constituents from SCT in our previous study, the results of network pharmacology studies indicated some potential targets (AChE, MAOs and NMDAR) for SCT. Therefore, the neuroprotective SCT sub-fractions were further tested in vitro for their efficacy on the potential targets. Encouragingly, the results of the fraction-targets in vitro experiments actually supported the network pharmacology results in this study. However, different sub-fractions contained different natural products, the content of natural products were also various, which resulted in the different effects of different sub-fractions to these potential target in this study. Certainly, in the next stage, the further studies would carry out to explain the bioactivity mechanism of different sub-fractions on their specific targets.

    Conclusion
   </h2>
   <p>
    SCT neuroprotective sub-fractions have moderate potency of scavenging radicals, inhibiting AChE, MAOs and NMDAR, which are the possible mechanisms of its neuroprotective effect. The identified and other related constituents in SCT may have affects on biological systems to alter AChE, MAO-B, GluN2B-NMDAR, A2AR and CB2R, to exert their therapeutic potential in the probable treatment of AD or PD.
