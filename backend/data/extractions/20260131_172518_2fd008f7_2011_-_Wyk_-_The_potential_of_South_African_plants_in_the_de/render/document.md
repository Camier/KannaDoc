## Abstract

Southern Africa is an important focal point of botanical and cultural diversity but only a few plant species have hitherto become fully commercialised as medicinal products. In recent years there has been an upsurge in research and development activity, resulting in several new products and new crops. In this review, more than 90 of the best-known and most promising indigenous South African plants are listed and subjectively evaluated in the context of their potential for commercialisation as medicinal products for a variety of applications. The history of product development relating to the following species is briefly discussed and the plants and some of their products are illustrated: *Agathosma betulina* (buchu), *Aloe ferox* (bitter aloe), *Artemisia afra* (African wormwood), *Aspalathus linearis* (rooibos tea), *Bulbine frutescens* (burn jelly plant); *Cyclopia genistoides* (honeybush tea), *Harpagophytum procumbens* (devil's claw), *Hoodia gordonii* (hoodia, ghaap), *Hypoxis hemerocallidea* ("African potato"), *Lippia javanica* (fever tea), *Mesembryanthemum tortuosum* (= *Sceletium tortuosum*) (kanna, kougoed), *Pelargonium sidoides* ("Umckaloabo"), *Siphonochilus aethiopicus* (African ginger), *Sutherlandia frutescens* (= *Lessertia frutescens*) (cancer bush), *Warburgia salutaris* (pepperbark tree) and *Xysmalobium undulatum* ("Uzara"). The main factors that are apparently responsible for failure or success will be highlighted, especially the importance of marketing strategy, proof of concept and barriers to market entry.

# 1. Introduction

The first systematic account of the medicinal plants of South Africa were published by Pappe (1847, 1850, 1854, 1857, 1862, 1868), who described all the most important traditional herbal medicines known at the time. The *Flora Capensis* (a colonial flora) started by Harvey and Sonder (1860, 1862, 1864) included anecdotal information about the medicinal uses of several species and was probably intended as a plant use catalogue to facilitate the British imperial trade in plant products. A historically important book on medicinal plants is that of Smith (1888, revised in 1895) which provides insight into the most popular traditional medicine of the Eastern Cape region at that time. The *Flora of South Africa* published in six volumes by Marloth (1913–1932) also included information about commercially relevant plants. Marloth was a trained pharmacist with a special interest in medicinal plants. An important milestone in the documentation of medicinal plants was the detailed and comprehensive work of Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), “The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa”, which is still regularly cited in scientific publications. Van Wyk et al. (1997) further conceptualised and popularised the field of medicinal plants in South Africa with the book entitled “Medicinal Plants of South Africa”, which included short scientific monographs of 132 of the most popular and widely used medicinal plants. An updated and expanded edition, now including 150 monographs, is available (Van Wyk et al., 2009). Van Wyk and Gericke (2000) presented detailed information on a large number of medicinal plants in Part 2 of the book “People’s Plants”, which includes chapters on general medicines, tonic plants, mind and mood plants, women’s health, wounds, burns and skin conditions, dental care, perfumes and repellents, and soaps and cosmetics. A comprehensive list of southern African medicinal plants (with literature references) is that of Arnold et al. (2002). Several other books provided valuable information on a regional level, especially those on Zulu medicinal plants by Hutchings et al. (1996), useful Namibian plants by Von Koenen (2001) and Sotho medicinal plants by Moffett (2010). Especially relevant in the context of new product development is the book edited

by Diederichs (2006), entitled “Commercialising medicinal plants. A South African guide”. The various chapters cover many aspects of research and development, including sustainable harvesting, conservation, trade regulations, economics, propagation, cultivation, chemistry and pharmacology, processing and packaging, marketing, business development and benefit-sharing.

The aim of this paper is to give a historical perspective on the commercialisation of medicinal plants in South Africa, to evaluate the progress that has been made and to highlight the potential of the South African medicinal flora for future research and development. A subjective evaluation of the commercial potential of more than 90 indigenous species is presented, together with brief reviews of a selection of 16 medicinal plants that are of particular interest in new product development.

# 2. The diversity of potentially useful medicinal plants in South Africa

The indigenous biological resources of Africa and the commercialisation of plants in Africa were reviewed by Geldenhuys and Van Wyk (2002) and Okole and Odhav (2002). According to the “African Plant Checklist and Database Project” (Klopper et al., 2006), 50 136 angiosperm taxa occur in Africa south of the Sahara (32 424 taxa in tropical Africa and 22 755 taxa in southern Africa). The last two numbers add up to 55 179 but the discrepancy is due to different taxonomic treatments in the two regions. This diversity represents perhaps 20 to 25% of the global total. The potential commercial importance of this resource can be judged by the comprehensive list of African medicinal plants (Neuwinger, 2000), where more than 5 400 medicinal plant taxa and over 16 300 medicinal uses are listed. This means that 10.8% of the African flora is known to be used in traditional medicine. The corresponding statistic for southern Africa is an estimated 3 000 species or 13.8% of the flora (Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000) or the more exact count of 2 942 species (administered to humans), representing 13.5% of the flora, presented by Arnold et al. (2002). These figures are based on an angiosperm species count of 21 817 for

southern Africa (Germishuizen and Meyer, 2003). The global review of commercialised medicinal plants by Van Wyk and Wink (2004) indicated that 83 African medicinal plants have been commercialised (as branded products) and that at best only 14 southern African species can be considered to be partially or fully commercialised compared to 336 species in Europe, for example. The most valuable of all medicinal plants may well be *Aloe vera* L. (of North African or perhaps Arabian origin) — fresh *Aloe vera* gel products had an annual retail value of approximately US\$ 125 million in 2004 (Afolayan and Adebola, 2006).

From the data given above it is clear that there is a huge potential source of species, crops and products that are available for basic and applied research, as well as new product development. A list of the most promising indigenous South African species is presented in Table 1, showing that at least 90 medicinal plants can be considered for further development and commercialisation. Author citations for botanical species names are given in Table 1 and are not repeated in the text.

# 3. Historical perspectives on new herbal product development in South Africa

A large number of medicinal plants are regularly sold as crude, unprocessed drugs on traditional markets in various parts of South Africa (Cunningham, 1988; Williams et al., 1997; Mander, 1998; Von Ahlefeldt et al., 2003; Street et al., 2008; see also Ndhlala et al. (in press)). The volumes and market value of these products are considerable. It has been estimated by Mander (1998) that the total volume of medicinal products traded annually in South Africa may exceed 20 000 tonnes, with a turnover of approximately US\$ 60 million per year. There is a general trend to develop and brand these traditional products so that they resemble more closely those consumer products that are sold as over-the-counter medicines and herbal supplements. Some of the first products in these informal markets were produced by the company Impilo Drugs north of Durban. Examples are shown by Diederichs (2006) and Ndhlala et al. (in press).

In contrast to the large diversity of products in informal markets, only a few indigenous plants have thus far been developed for the formal market (health shops and pharmacies). These products are available as processed and standardised materials in modern packaging and in various branded dosage forms such as teas, tinctures, tablets, capsules or ointments. The 16 South African traditional medicines that have been partly or fully developed as commercial crops and products are shown in alphabetical order in Fig. 1. These are *Agathosma betulina*, *Aloe ferox*, *Artemisia afra*, *Aspalathus linearis*, *Bulbine frutescens*, *Cyclopia genistoides*, *Harpagophytum procumbens*, *Hoodia gordonii*, *Hypoxis hemerocallidea*, *Lippia javanica*, *Mesembryanthemum tortuosum* (= *Sceletium tortuosum*), *Pelargonium sidoides*, *S. aethiopicus*, *S. frutescens* (= *Lessertia frutescens*), *Warburgia salutaris* and *Xysmalobium undulatum*. These species are briefly discussed below, with emphasis on their commercial history.

The process of commercialisation in South Africa can be divided into four phases:

- (1) Historical phase. Old South African products, first commercialised more than 100 years ago, which include *Agathosma* spp., *A. ferox*, *A. linearis*, *Cyclopia* spp., *H. procumbens*, *P. sidoides* and *X. undulatum*. These products are well known in the international trade and most of them have a long track record of exports to European countries.
- (2) Bioprospecting phase. This phase involves the large-scale, ethnobotanically-guided screening of species to identify plants with commercial potential. This phase started in the early 1960s, with the companies Noristan and Smith-Kline Beecham, in collaboration with organic chemists from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and botanists from the National Botanical Institute (National Herbarium) in Pretoria, as the main role players. During this time a project on edible plants was started at the National Food Research Institute of the CSIR, which included the first work on *Hoodia* species (Maharaj, 2009). When the Noristan project was terminated, a large data base with confidential research results was transferred to the University of Cape Town. A bioprospecting project was started at the CSIR in 1993 and is still ongoing. More recently, there has been several multi-institutional projects (involving the South African National Biodiversity Institute and South African Universities) to explore the commercial potential of medicinal plants. Numerous scientific discoveries were made during this phase, including the isolation of monatin (a sweetener) from *Sclerochiton ilicifolius* (Vleggaar et al., 1992) and the discovery of P57 (an appetite suppressant) in *H. gordonii* (Van Heerden et al., 1998). Pioneering work on *H. hemerocallidea* also dates from this period, including the very first clinical study on an indigenous medicinal plant. The commercial history of *Hypoxis* (and subsequent “immune system boosters” derived from it) was reviewed by Drewes et al. (2008).
- (3) Commercialisation phase. This phase started in the mid 1990s with research and development aimed at producing branded health care products from well-known and widely used indigenous medicinal plants. A feature of this phase was the development of several new crops, based on the consideration that large-scale commercial development may not be sustainable if the raw materials are taken from nature. The projects and products were not based on the results of bioprospecting, but focused on the most popular South African traditional medicines that were already widely traded in informal markets or extensively used as traditional household remedies. The health benefits of the plant species were already in the public domain for a long time (in most cases for at least a century). The logic of this approach is clear — why look for “new” products when the best ones have already been identified through centuries of trial and error? Plants developed into branded products during this phase include *A. afra*,

into Aspen Pharmacare) in 1995 and 1996, which included a tincture made from low-thujone clones of *Artemisia afra*. The first research and development of *M. tortuosum* (= *Sceletium tortuosum*) also occurred during this period (Gericke and Van Wyk, 1997). The branded tinctures produced in the SA Druggists era served as role models and numerous similar tinctures (small and large scale) are now available. Another noteworthy effort to produce new crops and new herbal health care products is that of the company Phyto Nova (Pty) Ltd, responsible for the first branded products developed from *M. tortuosum*, *S. aethiopicus*, *S. frutescens* and *W. salutaris*. The last-mentioned was the origin of the concept of plant part replacement, i.e. the replacement of bark with chemically similar leaves, as a conservation measure. These products were developed as tablets and some are still available

under the Phyto Nova Natural Medicines brand (a new name given to the company when it was taken over by Thebe Medicare in 2005). Some of the prototypes and first branded products developed by Phyto Nova are shown in Fig. 1. This phase has seen an unprecedented increase in the number of scientific publications and citations in patents (details are given in Van Wyk, 2008a and Makunga et al., 2008). A scopus search on 25 April 2008 showed that the number of citations in publications of the above-mentioned 16 commercial species increased from a total of 102 up to the year 1995, to 469 in the period 1996 to 2005, whilst the number of citations in patents rose from 72 to 438 in the corresponding periods (data from Table 1 in Van Wyk, 2008a).

Management: Biodiversity Act of 2004 (NEMBA) came into effect on the 1st of April 2008. The Act attempts to ensure the equitable distribution of the benefits to be derived from the commercialisation of the South African flora. The implications of benefit sharing in practice have been discussed by several authors in the book edited by *Denzil Phillips International* (2009). Whilst the aims of the Act are laudable, the implementation of the regulations is impractical and may inadvertently discourage rather than encourage innovation in this potentially important sector of the economy. A review of relevant legislation and regulations can be found elsewhere in this issue (*Myburgh, in press*).

A very brief summary of the commercial history and published information for each of 16 commercially important

medicinal plants of South Africa (see Fig. 1 and Table 1) is presented below. Monographs of these plants and general information about them can be found in *Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk* (1962), *Hutchings et al.* (1996), *Van Wyk et al.* (1997, 2009), *Van Wyk and Gericke* (2000), *Von Ahlefeldt et al.* (2003), *Van Wyk and Wink* (2004), *Diederichs* (2006), *Van Wyk* (2008a), *Brendler et al.* (2010) and *Gurib-Fakim et al.* (2010). A broad review of the ethnobotany, basic biology, taxonomy, biosystematics, genetics, chemistry and biological activity of most of the species was provided by *Van Wyk* (2008a), so that these aspects are not discussed in detail here. Also excluded are pan-African species which have been commercialised elsewhere (or with manufacturing based on raw material supplies from other African countries), such as *Adansonia digitata*, *Centella asiatica*, *Kigelia africana*, *Prunus africana*, *Trichilia emetica* and *Withania somnifera*.

### 3.1. *A. betulina* (Rutaceae) — round leaf buchu (Fig. 1, 1A to E)

Round leaf buchu is endemic to the Cederburg region of South Africa and is an important plant in the Khoi-San tradition. It has been wild-harvested at least since 1820 and cultivated since the 1970s or perhaps even earlier (Fig. 1, 1A). Recent efforts in crop development have resulted in buchu now being a viable option for small-scale farming (although producer prices have fluctuated wildly in recent years). Recently growers experienced severe losses, ascribed to a soilborne disease (Bezuidenhout et al., 2010). Tinctures of buchu (“buchu brandy”, Fig. 1, 1D and medicinal products, Fig. 1, 1E) have a great reputation as general health tonics, stomachics, aromatic bitters, diuretics and mild urinary antiseptics (Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000). The major volatile compounds of round leaf buchu are isomenthone

and diosphenol (Kaiser et al., 1975; Posthumus et al., 1996; Collins et al., 1996; Moolla and Viljoen, 2008), which are not only responsible for the distinctive flavour (not unlike *cassis*) but probably also for antispasmodic, antiseptic and diuretic activities (Wichtl and Bisset, 2000, Lis-Balchin et al., 2001; Moolla and Viljoen, 2008). The closely related oval leaf buchu (*A. crenulata*), as well as hybrids between the two species, are less desirable due to high levels of pulegone, a potentially harmful substance.

## 3.2. *A. ferox* (Xanthorrhoeaceae) — bitter aloe, Cape aloe (Fig. 1, 2A to G)

*A. ferox* has a very long history of use in southern Africa, as is evidenced by a San rock painting (Reynolds 1950) depicting

{10}------------------------------------------------

humans interacting with aloes. At current levels of demand, wild-crafting can be done without serious damage to natural populations (Newton and Vaughan, 1996). The first *A. ferox* plantation (6 ha) was established by Dr Tewis Muller on the farm Vinklaagte near Albertinia in 1976 (Fig. 1, 2A). Several other plantations have recently been established (e.g. 19 ha on the farm Tierfontein near Albertinia, in February 2008). By growing the plants in rows on open flat terrain, the harvesting operation becomes more efficient (because of easy access to the plants by both people and vehicles) thus reducing overall production costs and allowing for irrigation (by tractor-drawn water carts) during droughts so as to ensure a steady supply of raw materials. The bitter yellow leaf exudate (Fig. 1, 2D) is tapped by stacking the cut leaves around a hollow in the ground (lined with an animal skin or nowadays plastic sheeting), allowing the liquid to collect in the hollow. The exudate is boiled on open fires to reduce the water content, so that it solidifies to form a dark brown or black, glass-like substance known as aloe lump or Cape aloes (Fig. 1, 2C). This laxative medicine has been exported to Europe since 1761 (Marloth, 1913–1932; Kruger and Beyers, 1977; Robertson, 1979). Aloin (syn. barbaloin), an anthrone-C-glycoside, is the main laxative compound in aloe lump (Van Wyk et al., 1995). Annual exports in recent years amounted to ca. 350 tonnes (Knapp, 2006). The aloe lump is sold as is (Fig. 1, 2E) or tinctures containing aloe lump are used as traditional bitter tonics and stomachics (Fig. 1, 2F, 2G), reputed to also have anti-arthritis and anti-inflammatory properties (Newall et al., 1996; Blumenthal et al., 1998; Wichtl and Bisset, 2000; ESCOP, 2003). Nowadays the non-bitter, leaf parenchyma gel, obtained as “jelly” through a patented process (O’Brien et al., in press) and used to produce gel drinks, is the most popular product for the local industry (Fig. 1, 2F). A wide range of cosmetics and skin care products are also based on *A. ferox* gel. Another potential use of the gel is as a pharmaceutical excipient in novel drug delivery systems from renewable sources (Fischer et al., 2000). The work of the Aloe Council of South Africa (a non-profit company founded in 2003) has led to the development of a South African national standard for aloe raw materials, published in 2007 (Standards South Africa, 2007). There are important differences between the gels of *A. ferox* and *A. vera* — the South African gel product has polysaccharides of the arabinogalactan and rhamnogalacturonan types and it lacks acetylated sugars (Mabusela et al., 1990; O’Brien et al., in press). The quality control criteria for *A. vera* gel are therefore not applicable to *A. ferox*. There are opportunities to develop new products for human and animal health care, not only from *A. ferox* but also from other species such as *A. arborescens* and *A. marlothii*. Grace et al. (2008, in press) provided reviews of the traditional uses of *Aloe* species in southern Africa.

### 3.3. *A. afra* (Asteraceae) — African wormwood (Fig. 1, 3A to F)

African wormwood (*wildeals* in Afrikaans, *lengana* in Sotho and *umhlonjane* in Xhosa and Zulu) is one of the most popular and widely used traditional medicines in southern and eastern

Africa (from Cape Town to Addis Abeba). The aromatic leaves are used for the treatment of a wide range of ailments (Dykman, 1908; Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962; Hutchings et al., 1996; Van Wyk et al., 1997; Neuwinger, 2000; Von Koenen, 2001; see also Bora and Sharma, 2011). It is the most important bitter tonic and appetite stimulant of Cape herbal medicine (Dykman, 1908; Thring and Weitz, 2006; Rood, 2008, Van Wyk 2008b) and is commonly taken for respiratory ailments and stomach pain. The essential oil of *A. afra* is exceptionally variable (Graven et al., 1990; Lawrence, 1996; Viljoen et al., 2006) but often contains 1,8-cineole (=eucalyptol),  $\alpha$ -thujone,  $\beta$ -thujone, camphor and borneol as main monoterpenoids, together with chrysanthenyl acetate and other sesquiterpenoids. It is considered to be a useful substitute for armoire oil, which is produced from *A. vulgaris* L. and used in perfumes and as flavouring agent. Mukinda and Syce (2007) studied acute and chronic toxicity of *A. afra* essential oil (both quite low) but the level of thujone (which is a toxic compound) in the experimental material was not reported.

The plant is cultivated in home gardens as a medicinal herb and rooted cuttings are available from retail nurseries in South Africa. The first experimental plantings were made by Prof. Earle Graven at Fort Hare University (see Graven et al., 1990) in the late 1980s as part of a still ongoing research project on essential oils and the first commercial plantation at Gouda in the Western Cape Province of South Africa in 1995 (Fig. 1, 3A) as part of the South African Druggists project. The first commercial products based on low-thujone material were developed under the brand names of Healer’s Choice in 1996 (as a tincture, Fig. 1, 3C) and Phyto Nova in 2002 (as tablets, Fig. 1, 3D).

### 3.4. *A. linearis* (Fabaceae) — rooibos tea (Fig. 1, 4A to E)

Rooibos tea has become a popular herbal tea with a growing reputation of having important health benefits, including anti-spasmodic, anti-oxidant, anti-ageing and anti-eczema activities (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962; Van Wyk et al., 1997, 2009; Burger and Wachter, 1998; Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000; Van Wyk and Wink, 2004; Joubert et al., 2008; Joubert and De Beer, 2011). It has been used as a milk substitute for infants suffering from colic and has become popular as a health drink because of the absence of caffeine or other stimulants. It is one of the most successful and important of the indigenous industries. Annual production from plantations has reached 20 000 tonnes per annum and export volumes now exceed local consumption. The modest beginnings and early growth of the industry is described by Anonymous (1975), where mention is made of the first tea-makers of the Cederberg (of Khoi-San descent), the first commercialisation by Benjamin Ginsberg in 1904, the pioneering crop development efforts of Louis Leipoldt, P. le Fras Nortier and Oloff Bergh (and later also James Van Putten) and the background history of the establishment of the Rooibos Tea Control Board in 1954, as a single-channel marketing system to try and stabilise the wildly fluctuating supply and demand for rooibos tea. Amongst the early brands were Cederberg, Cedro, Clantee, Eleven O’Clock, Freshpak,

{11}------------------------------------------------

Grandiflora, Laager and Union. The chalcone aspalathin is the main phenolic compound (1 mg per g in fermented and up to 50 mg per g in unfermented tea) and is used for quality control (Joubert et al., 2008; Joubert and De Beer, 2011). Only the so-called Red type or Rocklands type is cultivated, but there is a renewed interest in harvesting some of the wild types for niche markets and Fair Trade networks (Van Wyk et al., 1997, 2009; Raynolds and Ngcwangu, 2010; Hawkins et al., 2011). Noteworthy recent innovations are the development of green and espresso rooibos tea (Fig. 1, 4D, E). Detailed reviews of rooibos tea are those of Joubert et al. (2008) and especially Joubert and De Beer (2011).

### 3.5. *B. frutescens* (Xanthorrhoeaceae) — burn jelly plant, ibhucu (Fig. 1, 5A to E)

The fresh leaf gel of *B. frutescens* and several other species are traditionally used topically to stop bleeding and to treat burns, cracked lips, cuts, grazes, itches, mosquito bites, rashes, ringworm, sores, wounds and herpes (Smith, 1895; Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk 1962; Roberts, 1990; Van Wyk et al. 1997, 2009; Van Wyk and Gericke 2000; Rood, 2008). A recent in vivo study has validated the traditional use of *B. frutescens* and *B. natalensis* leaf gel in the treatment of wounds (Pather et al., 2011). A tea made from the fresh whole plant (including roots) of *B. abyssinica* is taken by women to treat back pain, bladder and vaginal problems, cough, infertility and unspecified ailments (Van Wyk et al., 2008). Infusions of the roots of several *Bulbine* species are taken to treat blood disorders, convulsions, diabetes, diarrhoea, nausea (vomiting), rheumatism, urinary complaints and venereal diseases (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962; Van Wyk et al., 1997, 2009; Felhaber and Mayeng, 1997; Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000; Rood, 2008). The main commercial interest is in the leaf gel, developed as branded products since 1995, for example as Montagu Museum Bulbine Crème (Fig. 1, 5E) and the BulbAloe range developed by J. Levine in 2004. A patented product (Widgerow and Chait, 1998) comprising microporous paper tape impregnated with a combination of bulbine gel (12.5 to 25% but preferable 20%) with pantheol and asiaticoside was shown (in a clinical study of nearly 300 patients) to enhance wound healing and hasten scar maturation. The healing effects are likely to be due to polysaccharides and/or glycoproteins in the leaf gel, as well as hydrating effects (Widgerow et al., 2000).

### 3.6. *C. genistoides* (Fabaceae) — honeybush tea (Fig. 1, 6A to E)

A comprehensive review of this important health drink is presented by Joubert et al. (in press). Honeybush tea lacks caffeine and has proven health benefits, including antioxidant, antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and oestrogenic activity. The original product dates back to at least the middle of the eighteenth century (Pappe, 1847) and was made from *C. genistoides* (Marloth, 1913–1932) (Fig. 1, 6A). However, *C. intermedia* E. Mey. (Fig. 1, 6B) and *C. subternata* Vogel (Fig. 1, 6C) are also

important sources of this tea, known respectively as mountain tea and *vlei* tea. The first branded products date back to the 1960s (e.g. Caspa Cyclopia Tea) (Joubert et al., in press). The industry is rapidly growing as a result of crop development by De Lange (1997), as well as improved processing and pharmacological studies, as summarised by Joubert et al. (in press). Important basic scientific information was contributed by De Nysschen et al. (1996), who first discovered and identified mangiferin as the major phenolic compound in honeybush tea, and Schutte (1997), who resolved the complicated infrageneric taxonomy of the genus *Cyclopia*. Honeybush tea has become very popular in recent years and the industry is poised for substantial growth (Joubert et al., in press).

### 3.7. *H. procumbens* (Pedaliaceae) — devil's claw (Fig. 1, 7A to D)

Devil's claw is widely distributed in the Kalahari region of southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) and has become a popular herbal medicine to treat arthritis, painful joints, dyspepsia and loss of appetite (Blumenthal et al., 1998; Newall et al., 1996; Wichtl and Bisset, 2000; Wegener, 2000; ESCOP, 2003; Van Wyk and Wink, 2004). Mild analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties have been reported in several clinical studies, reviewed by Wegener (2000), Chrubasik et al. (2003), Gagnier et al. (2004) and De Silva et al. (2011). The activity has been ascribed to iridoid glycosides — mainly harpagoside (0.5% to 3%), with smaller amounts of harpagide and procumbide, but total extracts are more active than the individual iridoids. The commercial history of devil's claw is poorly recorded but can be traced back to at least ca. 1907, when G.H. Mehnert started exporting dried tubers from Namibia to Germany (Cole, 2009). It is interesting that the plant is depicted in rock engravings in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa, indicating that the plant may have been important to Khoi-San people since ancient times. One of the first experimental plantations (1 ha) was established at Gouda in the Western Cape Province of South Africa in 1995 (Fig. 1, 7A). A review of the harvesting and export of this internationally well-known herbal product (mainly from Namibia) is presented by Stewart and Cole (2005) and Cole (2009), who highlighted the problems associated with benefit sharing when a plant is distributed across national boundaries.

### 3.8. *H. gordonii* (Apocynaceae) — hoodia, ghaap (Fig. 1, 8A to D)

*Hoodia* species and related plants of the family Apocynaceae are important traditional food sources of the Khoi-San people, first explicitly recorded by Marloth in 1932 as being useful in suppressing appetite (Marloth, 1913–1932). The history of research and development work on hoodia was reviewed by Maharaj (2009). The appetite-suppressant effect has been ascribed to a pregnane compound known as P57 (Van Heerden et al., 1998; Van Heerden, 2008) but there is as yet no published human clinical data to support the claim that

{12}------------------------------------------------

hoodia products can safely suppress appetite. Despite the lack of scientific information on efficacy and appropriate therapeutic doses, hoodia products have become popular all over the world (Jayawardane, 2011). The agreement reached between the CSIR and the San community (Maharaj, 2009) is one of the first examples of compensation of a local community for the benefits derived from the commercialisation of indigenous knowledge. A comprehensive review of *H. gordonii* was recently presented by Vermaak et al. (2011).

### 3.9. *H. hemerocallidea* (*Hypoxidaceae*) — star flower, *inkomfe*, “African potato” (Fig. 1, 9A–E)

This plant has become famous as a result of millions of rands spent on research and development since 1967, when *Hypoxis* phytosterols were first developed into a branded product (Harzol®) by an entrepreneur from Johannesburg (R. W. Liebenberg), who successfully marketed and sold it in Germany for the treatment of benign prostate hypertrophy (Drewes et al., 2008). A commercial preparation initially based on *Hypoxis* phytosterols (later on industrial sources) and claimed to have immune-stimulating effects was a huge market success in South Africa (Drewes and Horn, 1999; Drewes et al., 2008). The main active compounds of *Hypoxis* include rooperol (Drewes et al., 1984) which has patented anti-cancer activity (Drewes and Liebenberg, 1983) and phytosterols, which are still associated with over-the-counter immune-boosting products (Pegel 1973, 1997). Some in vitro evidence was published for the claimed immune-stimulant effects (Bouic et al., 1996). Extracts of the corms of *Hypoxis* (Fig. 1, 9D) are ingredients of an ever diversifying range of products used as anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatories, anti-diabetics and anti-convulsants (Drewes et al., 2008; see also the review by Owira and Ojewole, 2009).

### 3.10. *L. javanica* (*Verbenaceae*) — fever tea (Fig. 1, 10C to D)

Wild-harvested leaves of *L. javanica* and *L. scaberrima* have been used since the mid 1990s in branded infusions (herbal teas) to treat bronchitis, colds, coughs and fever. The plants are also traditionally used against numerous other ailments (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962; Hutchings et al., 1996; Van Wyk et al., 1997, 2009; Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000). The traditional uses, chemistry and pharmacology were reviewed by Pascual et al. (2001). The essential oil of *L. javanica* is highly variable and five distinct chemotypes, each with its own main compound (myrcenone, carvone, piperitenone, ipsenone or linalool) were described by Viljoen et al. (2005). Leaves of *Lippia scaberrima* are also used as tea but the main components of the oil are carvone, 1,8-cineole and limonene (Combrinck et al., 2006). Standardised chemotypes may be suitable for use as flavour components in herbal teas, in addition to their reputed medicinal benefits. Other species that have potential as ingredients of herbal teas (individually or in combination with other species) include *Leonotis leonurus* (Fig. 1, 10A), *Leysera gnaphalodes* (Fig. 1, 10B) and *Mentha longifolia* (Fig. 1, 10E), all of which have a long history of traditional use as medicinal teas in southern Africa (Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000).

### 3.11. *M. tortuosum* [syn. *Sceletium tortuosum*] (*Mesembryanthemaceae*) — *sceletium*, *kanna*, *kougoed* (Fig. 1, 11A to E)

*Kougoed*, *kanna* or *sceletium* is a traditional masticatory and sedative of the Nama people of South Africa, first recorded in detail by Simon van der Stel (1685) under the name “Channa”. In a molecular systematic study (Klak et al., 2007), *Sceletium* and other genera were formally subsumed under the genus *Mesembryanthemum*. The uses and properties have been described by Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), Watt (1967), Smith et al. (1996), Van Wyk and Gericke (2000), Van Wyk and Wink (2004), Gericke and Viljoen (2008) and Van Wyk et al. (2009). It is interesting to note that the first experimental plantings (Fig. 1, 11A) were made in 1996, more than 300 years after Van der Stel (1685) first suggested that profit could be made from growing and trading with *channa*. The activity of the plant and the traditional product (Fig. 1, 11B–D) is ascribed to serotonin reuptake-inhibiting alkaloids, of which mesembrine is the main compound (Gericke and Van Wyk, 1997). The first tablets containing powdered whole plants were produced by Phyto Nova in 2000 (Fig. 1, 11E). A benefit-sharing agreement was recently signed between HGH Pharmaceuticals and the South African San Council, who in turn entered into an agreement with the Nama communities of Kamiesberg in Namaqualand to share financial benefits that may result from commercialisation. Research and development work is currently underway to create what may become an important and commercially successful herbal sedative for international markets.

### 3.12. *P. sidoides* (*Geraniaceae*) — *rooirabas*, “Umckaloabo” (Fig. 1, 12A to D)

The interesting commercial history of this important plant, first developed and marketed in England in 1898 (for the treatment of tuberculosis), was described by Brendler and Van Wyk (2008). It is now mainly used for the treatment of bronchitis. Crop development started near Wellington in the Western Cape Province of South Africa in 1995 (Feiter, 2009), when the first plantations (Fig. 1, 12A) were established. Since the early 1990s, a tincture made from the tuberous roots (Fig. 1, 12C,D) has become one of the most successful phytomedicines in the world, with annual sales in Germany alone exceeding € 80 million. The medicinal properties are associated with coumarins, including umckalin and 5,6,7-methoxycoumarin (Kolodziej and Kayser, 1998; Kayser et al., 2001). Details of the commercial history, botany, chemistry, pharmacology and clinical studies can be found in the review of Brendler and Van Wyk (2008), whilst recent developments related to intellectual property rights are presented by Feiter (2009) and Myburgh (in press).

### 3.13. *S. aethiopicus* (*Zingiberaceae*) — African ginger (Fig. 1, 13A to D)

This plant is widely distributed in tropical Africa and the rhizomes and roots are very important and popular traditional

{13}------------------------------------------------

medicines, mainly used to treat asthma, candida, colds, coughs, headache and malaria (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962; Van Wyk et al., 1997, 2009; Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000; Crouch et al., 2000; Van Wyk and Wink, 2004; Van Wyk, 2008a). Pioneering research on the cultivation and tissue culture propagation of *S. aethiopicus* were done during the early 1990s by G. Nichols (at the Silverglen Municipal Nursery near Durban — Fig. 1, 13A) and J.N. Eloff (at the Kirstenbosch Research Centre in Cape Town). It is now commercially cultivated on a small scale at several locations in South Africa. The first branded products (tablets made from freeze-dried rhizomes and roots) were marketed by Phyto Nova in 2000 (Fig. 1, 13C,D). The major chemical constituents are sesquiterpenoids of the furanoid type (Van Wyk et al., 1997; Holzapfel et al., 2002; Viljoen et al., 2002) and diarylheptanoids (Van Wyk et al., 2009). Research and development at the CSIR is ongoing (see brief review by Van Wyk, 2008a).

### *3.14. S. frutescens* [syn. *Lessertia frutescens*] (*Fabaceae*) — cancer bush, sutherlandia (Fig. 1, 14A to D)

Cancer bush is traditionally used in southern Africa as a tonic and adaptogen (known in Sesotho as *Musapelo*) to alleviate stress and anxiety (Moteetee and Van Wyk, 2007). Published and unpublished traditional uses and anecdotes are summarised in a review by Van Wyk and Albrecht (2008). These include asthma, cancer (prevention and treatment), chronic bronchitis, colds, cough, diabetes, dysentery, fever, gastritis, heartburn, heart failure, indigestion, influenza, kidney and liver ailments, oesophagitis, peptic ulcers, poor appetite, rheumatism, unspecified wasting diseases and urinary tract infections. It has received special attention because of anecdotes suggesting dramatic improvements in the quality of life in HIV/AIDS patients and a reduction in the muscle-wasting (cachexia) effect of AIDS. A safety study done by the Medical Research Council of South Africa (Seier et al., 2002) and a clinical (phase I) study (Johnson et al., 2007) showed no signs of toxicity or side effects. The leaves contain a diversity of chemical compounds (reviewed by Van Wyk and Albrecht, 2008), including pinitol, triterpenoid saponins, flavonoids and amino acids (such as *L*-canavanine and GABA), to which various biological activities have been ascribed. Commercial plantations were established in the late 1990s (e.g. at Sannieshof in the North-West Province, Fig. 1, 14A). The first branded products were tablets made from powdered leaves of a selected chemotype that became known as the SU1 type — the prototypes and products dating from 2000 and marketed by Phyto Nova are shown in Fig. 1, 14D.

### *3.15. W. salutaris* (*Canellaceae*) — pepperbark tree (Fig. 1, 15A to E)

The pepperbark tree is one of the most important and popular traditional medicines of tropical Africa. The bark (Fig. 1, 15D) is widely used to treat abdominal pain, cancer, constipation, colds, coughs, fever, headache, influenza, malaria, rheumatism and venereal diseases (Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000;

Van Wyk et al., 2009). The tree has become rare and endangered in South Africa as a result of excessive harvesting of bark, so that chemically similar leaves (with the same pungent taste as the bark) were used to produce the first branded product (tablets), marketed by Phyto Nova in 2000 as a natural antibiotic to treat oral and oesophageal thrush (Fig. 1, 15E). The conservation and cultivation of *W. salutaris* were initiated by the company HL& H (now Mondi Forests), who started a living gene bank of about 3000 trees at their White River Nursery. Using expertise in the rooting of *Eucalyptus* cuttings, a large number of trees were propagated for distribution in 1996, when *W. salutaris* was chosen as South Africa's "Tree of the Year". By the year 2000, Mr Rodger Stewart has established a small plantation on a farm north of Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, using horticultural experience gained in commercial tea plantations. As a result, freeze-dried leaves and bark are now available in small commercial quantities. Recently, a new product was developed by Phyto Nova Natural Medicines (from freeze-dried *Warburgia* leaf) to treat cystitis. The bark and leaves contain drimane sesquiterpenoids (Mashimbye et al., 1999), including warburganal, mukaadial, salutarisolide, polygodial and isopolygodial, as well as muzigadial (Rabe and Van Staden, 2000).

### *3.16. X. undulatum* (*Apocynaceae*) — *Uzara*, *ishongwe* (Fig. 1, 16A to D)

The roots of *X. undulatum* are important in traditional medicine in South Africa. It is used to treat abscesses, afterbirth cramps, colic, diarrhoea, headache, hysteria, stomach cramps and wounds, as recorded by Watt (1935), Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), Pujol (1990), Hutchings and Van Staden (1994), Hutchings et al. (1996), Van Wyk et al. (1997, 2009) and Von Koenen (2001). It also has a long history of commercial use and has been cultivated in South Africa (near Pretoria) since 1904 (Fig. 1, 16A). Extracts were introduced into the German pharmaceutical market in 1909 (or 1911, according to Ghorbani et al., 1997) and marketed (under the name "Uzara") for the treatment of non-specific, acute diarrhoea. The roots contain uzarin and xysmalorin as major cardenolide glycosides (Ghorbani et al., 1997), to which the inhibition of intestinal motility is ascribed.

# 4. Species with commercial potential as herbal products

As shown in Table 1, there are numerous species that stand out as having exceptional potential for the development of new phytomedicines, dietary supplements or general tonics. Some are also suitable for new ethnoveterinary products, although this application is not specifically dealt with here (see McGaw and Eloff, 2008). The evaluation of species in Table 1 is somewhat subjective, but the following aspects are important: (1) The species must be suitable for cultivation (or be abundant in nature to allow wild-crafting — i.e. sustainable harvesting from the wild); (2) it must have a well-recorded history of traditional use (preferably in more than one traditional healing culture); (3) it must be regularly used, with no evidence of side

{14}------------------------------------------------

effects; (4) it must be amongst the most popular indigenous remedies for the particular indication it is being developed/ marketed for and (5) there must be a potential demand for the product. There may be a demand for more sophisticated dosage forms and standardised products within the culture where it is well known, or a new demand may be created around compelling evidence of safety and efficacy in the historical track record of the species, preferably with interesting ethnobotanical information to support the marketing efforts.

The list in Table 1 includes several well-known and commercially important species that have for unknown reason never received much attention in South Africa, such as *Aloe arborescens*, *Centella asiatica*, *Kigelia africana*, *Pelargonium graveolens* and *Withania somnifera*. Also listed are several plants that appear to have considerable potential, including *Alepidea amatymbica*, *Aloe marlothii*, *Aspalathus pendula*, *Balota africana*, *Chironia baccifera*, *Colenema album*, *Dicoma anomala*, *D. capensis*, *Dodonaea viscosa*, *Eriocephalus africanus*, *E. punctulatus*, *Gethyllis* species, *Gunnera perpensa*, *Helichrysum odoratissimum*, *Heteropyxis natalensis*, *Leonotis leonurus*, *Leysera gnaphalodes*, *Mentha longifolia*, *Myrothamnus flabellifolius*, *Olea europaea* subsp. *africana*, *Osmitopsis asteriscoides*, *Salvia africana-caerulea*, *Sclerocarya birrea*, *Tarchonanthus camphoratus*, *Tetradenia riparia*, *Teucrium trifidum*, *Trichilia dregeana*, *T. emetica*, *Tulbaghia violacea*, *Viscum capense*, *Ximenia americana* and *X. caffra*.

# 5. Discussion

### 5.1. Proof of concept and scientific data

Scientific evidence to substantiate medicinal claims appears to be the most important limiting factor in the development of indigenous herbal products. Traditional uses may be a good starting point in product development but is unlikely to lead to sustainable commercial success in the long run. Examples that come to mind are *H. hemerocallidea*, *Aloe vera* and *H. gordonii*. *Hypoxis* was the subject of numerous studies in the 1970s and formed the basis of a lucrative trade in so-called “immune-stimulants” but as yet there is no convincing *in vivo* evidence published in peer-reviewed journals. Aloe gel health drinks are perhaps the best example of a major international herbal product that still lacks convincing clinical evidence of therapeutic benefits. The almost complete absence of published clinical studies is especially noteworthy when the enormous annual turnover of this industry is considered. (Perhaps no-one wants to spoil a good marketing story with inconvenient facts?). Weight loss products are often purely market-driven and *Hoodia* appears to be no exception. The lack of reliable published clinical evidence on the therapeutic dose and its efficacy as appetite suppressant does not seem to be regarded as a serious concern and there are still numerous *Hoodia*-containing products available on the international market.

The main stimulus for marketing success of herbal products appears to be proof of concept in the form of human trials. The commercial success of two of the most famous and valuable indigenous species can be related to clinical evidence of efficacy

in the form of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: *H. procumbens* became internationally known after the first clinical studies were conducted in France and Germany in the 1960s; *P. sidoides* became the basis of a very lucrative over-the-counter medicine only after several clinical studies (summarised in Brendler and Van Wyk, 2008). The recent boom in the rooibos tea industry may at least partly be ascribed to a growing body of scientific evidence indicating important health benefits. Clinical evidence in the form of post-marketing surveillance or double-blind, placebo-controlled studies may pay healthy dividends in the long run, despite the large financial inputs required for this type of research. A good example is the marketing success achieved with *P. sidoides*. However, this depends on the product being developed. No company will spend a lot of money on clinical research to develop an anti-diarrhoeal as there are already many such products available.

## 5.2. Intellectual property rights

Legislation aimed at protecting the intellectual property rights of indigenous communities, despite good intentions, is likely to become an important new barrier to entry in commercialisation and product development. Recent experiences (Denzil Phillips International, 2009), have shown that some of the regulations are impractical and that prospective developers are subjected to excessive bureaucracy. See also the review by Myburgh (in press) in this issue.

## 5.3. The importance of marketing

Sustainable commercial success appears to be achieved only after many years of investment and marketing. The few indigenous plants that have become important commercial crops and products all have a very long history of crop and product development, with large amounts of money spent on marketing over many years. These include *A. betulina* (since 1820), *A. ferox* (since 1761), *A. linearis* (since 1904), *C. genistoides* (since 1847; branded since the 1960s), *H. procumbens* (since ca. 1907), *P. sidoides* (since 1898) and *X. undulatum* (since 1909). In 2002, it was estimated that the establishment of a new brand of herbal medicine in South Africa would cost at least R 12 million rands or ca. € 1.2 million (Louis Schutte, S.A. Natural Products, personal communication, 2002). Multi-level marketing, the backbone of the enormous *Aloe vera* industry in the USA, has in recent years proven to be a highly successful strategy in South Africa and may become increasingly important in response to a very competitive retail market. There is no doubt that opportunities still exist for market-driven development projects based on those indigenous medicinal plant species listed in Table 1.

# 6. Conclusions

The exceptionally diverse South African flora comprises numerous species that can be developed as exciting new products (including herbal medicines and other health care products, herbal teas and functional foods). There is an urgent need to

{15}------------------------------------------------

encourage bioprospecting and new product development, to build local capacity in this field and to implement measures to counteract the negative perceptions and practical difficulties associated with restrictive new regulations. The development of a successful new product is a complicated process that requires hard work, technical skills, substantial investment and innovative marketing, sustained over long periods. The pioneers involved in this process often gain nothing except the satisfaction that they have created opportunities for the next generation of skillfull entrepreneurs to achieve market success. It is hoped that inspired and talented individuals will be allowed the freedom to maximise the opportunities presented by the rich diversity of the South African flora by developing innovative products in order to create new marketing opportunities in local and international markets, and to find new ways of generating wealth for the benefit of all.
