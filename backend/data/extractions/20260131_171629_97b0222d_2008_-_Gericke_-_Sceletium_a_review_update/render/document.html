    ABSTRACT
   </h2>
   <p>
    It is probable that plants of the genus
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    (Mesembryanthemaceae) have been used as masticatories and for the relief of thirst and hunger, to combat fatigue, as medicines, and for social and spiritual purposes by San hunter-gatherers (historically referred to as Bushmen) and Khoi pastoralists (historically referred to as Hottentots) for millennia before the earliest written reports of the uses of these plants by European explorers and settlers. The oral-tradition knowledge of the uses of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    by indigenous peoples has largely been eroded over the last three centuries due to conflicts with settlers, genocidal raids against the San, loss of land, the ravages of introduced diseases, and acculturation. Wild resources of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    have also been severely diminished by over-harvesting, poor veld-management, and possibly also by plant diseases.
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    was reviewed almost a decade ago and new results have emerged substantiating some of the traditional uses of one of South Africa's most coveted botanical assets, and suggesting dietary supplement, phytomedicine and new drug applications. This review aims to collate the fragmented information on past and present uses, the alkaloid chemistry and pharmacological evidence generated on
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    .

    species are among the most commercially promising South African plants, with potential applications of raw material, extracts and isolated compounds spanning di

    ry supplement, natural medicine, veterinary and pharmaceutical uses. More than a decade has passed since the first ethnopharmacological review of this genus by
    <a href="#block-11-0">Smith e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-11-0">al. (</a>
    1996). There have since been significant advances in all aspects of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    research, and an increasing number of commercial
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    products have appeared in the market place. Commercial
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    plantations have been established to address the need for sustainable supplies of standardised high quality raw material. The purpose of this review is to provide a short historical overview together with a comprehensive summary of past and recent developments in the chemistry, pharmacology, veterinary and clinical applications of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    , and to highlight the lacunae in our present knowledge of this fascinating endemic South African succulent genus.

    2. Botanical aspects
   </h1>
   <p>
    The generic circumscription of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    (Aizoaceae, subfamily Mesembryanthemoideae) had been reconsidered by various authors since the genus had been established in 1925 by N.E. Brown. This group of plants is characterised by the skeletonised leaf venation pattern visible in dried leaves (Fig. 1). In 1986, Bitttrich argued for a broader circumscription of
    <i>
     Phyllobolus
    </i>
    which included
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    as one of five subgenera. Since Gerbaulet was unable to find a synapomorphy (a unique derived character) for Bitttrich's broad concept of
    <i>
     Phyllobolus
    </i>
    , she reinstated
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    as a genus (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Gerbaulet,</a>
    <a href="#block-11-0">1996).</a>
    Using molecular techniques in combination with morphological characters,
    <a href="#block-11-0">Klak e</a>
    t
    <a href="#block-11-0">al. (</a>
    2007) proposed a much expanded generic concept, whereby a single genus,
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemum
    </i>
    (including
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    ), is recognized in the Mesembryanthemoideae. (For the purpose of this review

    The genus name is derived from 'sceletus' meaning skeleton which refers to the prominent lignified veins visible in the dry and withered leaves (Fig. 1). Of the 22 species described by Brown (1926), 8 were recognized in the revision of

    exhibits a climbing or decumbent habit and have characteristic succulent leaves with "bladder cells" or idiobasts. The flowers range from white, yellow to pale pink (Fig. 2). The fruit capsule contains numerous kidney-shaped seeds which are brown to black in color. The genus is distributed in the south-western parts of South Africa and has an affinity for arid environments (Fig. 3). The vernacular names include
    <i>

    <a href="#block-11-0">al., 1</a>
    979): "This plant is found with the Namaquas and then only on some of their mountains. It is gathered in October and is called
    <i>
     Canna
    </i>
    . It is held by them and surrounding tribes in as great esteem as the betel or areca with the Indians. They chew its stem as well as its roots, mostly all day, and become intoxicated by it, so that on account of this effect and its fragrance

    The Namaqua name for

    , recorded as
    <i>

    Some uncertainty has been caused by the occasional use of the same folk name,
    <i>

    , for plants of the genus

    species have masticatory, hunger- and thirst-relieving, mood-enhancing or other properties valued in
    <i>
     Sceletium

    . In 1662, the Namaquas gave
    <i>

    <i>
     kanna
    </i>
    or
    <i>
     channa
    </i>
    , Kolben was referring to a plant whose root was used by the Hottentots as a means of enjoyment, which they "chewed, kept in their mouth for some time, thus becoming excited and intoxicated", and the name
    <i>
     channa
    </i>
    designates certain species of

    Carl Peter Thunberg, the Swedish botanist and physician who had been a student of Linnaeus, made two journeys to the Eastern Cape between 1772 and 1774 and reported that valuable narcotic plants were found in the vicinity of the present-day town of Oudtshoorn in the Little Karoo, in the territory known as 'Cannaland', and formerly occupied by the Attaqua Khoikhoi (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Gordon, 1</a>
    996). This area of South Africa is still known as Cannaland at the present time. According to Thunberg (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Forbes, 1</a>
    986): "Kon, was a name given by the Hottentots to a shrub which grew here (
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemum emarcidum
    </i>
    ) [now
    <i>
     Sceletium emarcidum
    </i>
    ] and was famous all over the country. The Hottentots came far and near to fetch this shrub with the root, stalk and leaves which they stamp together, and afterwards twist them up like pig-tail tobacco; after which they let the mass ferment, and keep it by them for chewing, especially when they are thirsty. If chewed immediately after fermentation, it intoxicates. The word
    <i>
     kon
    </i>
    is said to signify a quid; the colonists call it
    <i>
     canna
    </i>
    root. It is found in the driest fields only, and is gathered chiefly by the Hottentots, who live near this spot. These afterwards hawke it about, frequently to a great distance, and exchange it for cattle and other commodities." In this passage, Thunberg himself identifies the plant as
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemum emarcidum
    </i>
    , now
    <i>
     Sceletium emarcidum
    </i>
    . Thunberg further reported that the San "first chew
    <i>
     canna
    </i>
    (
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemum
    </i>
    ), and afterwards smoke it". The notes to this passage by the editor identifies
    <i>
     canna
    </i>
    as "various species of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    , especially
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    (
    <i>
     Mesembryanthemaceae
    </i>
    ), esteemed for their narcotic properties when chewed or smoked" (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Forbes, 1</a>
    986). Thunberg reports on the use of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    by the Khoi for quenching thirst, after first having been allowed to putrify.
   </p>
   <p>
    It has been suggested that the
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    growing in the vicinity of the former areas of Attaqua and Inqua settlement allowed for the rise of powerful Khoi traders in
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Gordon, 1</a>
    996). The Karoo also featured as a centre of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    trade in the mid-nineteenth century when people of mixed Khoi and white ancestry traded in
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    , which was used to treat insomnia in adults, diarrhoea in children, and also chewed as a mild narcotic or intoxicant (

    The Afrikaans vernacular name

    According to Meiring,

It has a small seed, so it blows to places where it is stopped, and it lies there and grows. . . . The plant grows in winter, when the rains come. In the summer when the growing is over, and the leaves get yellowish and wilted, it is at its best. At the end of the growing season when most of the leaves are dead, then it is more powerful. It still work when its green, but it is very juicy, and you will lose a lot through the juice that drains out. You pick the
    <i>
     kougoed
    </i>
    , cut off the root,
    <a href="#block-11-0">and c</a>
    rush it with a rock, put it in a plastic bag, and tie it tightly. You can leave it in the sun to get warm. It is not necessary to keep it in the shade, it gets shade at night, and the sun doesn't harm it. The plant is left to sweat. After two to three days you mix it all together, and close it up again for another five to six days. On the eighth day after crushing you open it and spread out to dry in the sun as when you dry raisins. You leave it out until it is dry. If you do not do the whole process, the plant won't have power. . . . Small plants are not picked and are left for the following season. If you want to make
    <i>
     kougoed
    </i>
    for immediate use you can make a fire, scrape a hollow in the sand, put in [the freshly picked plant], cover with hot sand and leave for an hour.
   </p>
   <p>
    You use it when you feel like it. . . . You use it, then take it out of your mouth, and use it again when you want to. . . . It is not a poison; there is no such thing as too much. . . . I am used to using it, I use it when I feel like it. . . . I ate a lot of
    <i>
     kougoed
    </i>
    , but now in my later years I am not so partial to it. Sometimes I eat it, and sometimes I don't eat it for days. Sometimes I stay a month without it, but if I feel like it, then I will chew it.

    <i>

    is dipped in the milk and pressed until the milk becomes brown in color. The brown liquid is given to the baby. The baby won't suck on the cloth because it is salty and they don't like th

    in the old days, and you could sell it to the shops. Then the people ran after the money. This was about fifty years ago [about 1945], when I was about 16 or 17 years old. Many people sold it. In Springbok [a town in Namaqualand] the shop-owners said that you must bring them
    <i>

    . There are still shops that sell it. . . . The sheep are not the reason there is so little left. I looked after sheep night and day for many years, and walked behind them. They taste it here and there, but it is not a main food. It is almost an accident that they take it. Many people say the sheep destroyed it, but this is not true."

    Phytochemical exploration of the genus
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    is believed to have commenced in 1898 when Meiring isolated a crude alkaloid mixture from
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    . This was followed by the work of
    <a href="#block-11-0">Zwicky (</a>
    1914), who isolated several alkaloids including mesembrine and mesembrenine. It is believed that plant material of
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Sceletium expansum
    </i>
    was sent by Dr. Rudolf Marloth in South Africa to Prof. C. Hartwich in Zurich. The material was requested for E. Zwicky, a student of Prof. Hartwich who produced a dissertation "Über channa" in 1914.

    experiment was unfortunately carried out using different individual plants for the various experiments, so it is possible that the results observed were due to chemotypic variation between the plants, rather than the type of processing the material was subjected to. Using a similar approach Viljoen (2007, unpublished data) subdivided the aerial parts of a single robust plant into three portions. The three parts were processed as follows: (1) fresh material crushed under liquid nitrogen and transferred to a freeze drier for 36 h, (2) fresh material crushed under liquid

    nitrogen and the alkaloids immediately extracted and (3) fresh material gently bruised and dried at 50 °C for 48 h. The experiment was repeated five times. The alkaloids were extracted using an acid–base extraction method and the alkaloids were monitored by GC–MS. Analytical pure standards of mesembrenol, mesembrine and mesembrenone were used to confirm the identity of the various peaks. There was no significant difference in both total alkaloid yield as well as alkaloid ratios between the three treatments. A similar experiment will need to be devised to establish whether

    <a href="#block-11-0">Gericke,</a>

    It is rather surprising that despite the rapid development in analytical methods and the growing commercial interest generated locally and abroad in
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    -derived products, that the basic information on the quantitative and qualitative composition of alkaloids in the various species remains poorly explored. As is the case with most natural products, alkaloids are subjected to intrinsic and extrinsic factors which govern their production and accumulation in plants. These factors have yet to be explored in
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    . Furthermore,
    <i>
     Sceletium

    taxonomy has remained a topic of contention between modern taxonomists, challenging th
    <a href="#block-11-0">e ta</a>
    xonomic authenticity of the species from which alkaloids have previously been isolated. The various studies cited above clearly highlight congruencies and anomalies in the past and present information recorded for the various taxa emphasising the urgent need for a thorough biosystematic study of the entire genus, and including adequate sampling across the entire distribution range for each species.

    In 1889, Meiring injected an alkaloidal principle from
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    into the skin of a frog, resulting in a marked hypnotic effect. Meiring later isolated alkaloid mixture from
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    , and injected one to two drops under the skin of a frog resulting in an apparent effect within a few minutes, including rapid respiratory rate, marked moistness of skin, and uneasiness. After 10–12 min the respiratory rate became very slowed, and although the frog remained conscious, it could not right itself when placed on its back. Full recovery took place after 4–8 h. These results represent the average seen in a number of experiments with frogs, although in some cases the frog died. Meiring noted that even with a 10-fold increase in the dose used in frogs, the effect in guinea pigs was mild, with only uneasiness and refusal of food being noted. However, one guinea pig died 24 h later, while a second was fully recovered after 24 h (

    daily. The patient initially reported a transient increase in anxiety after taking medication, which would last up to 3 h, but was no longer apparent after the first week of treatment. A sustained improvement in mood was reported, with a marked decrease in generalised anxiety. The patient's insomnia improved at the onset of treatment. This low dose of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    proved to be an effective anxiolytic and mood-elevator in this patient. The
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    was discontinued after 4 months of continual use with no signs or symptoms of withdrawal.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the second case, a patient with a personality disorder was diagnosed as suffering from dysthymia by her psychologist. The patient felt despondent, socially withdrawn, felt tearful and empty, and had a feeling of pervasive sadness. There was no suicidal ideation, but mood was depressed alternating with anxiety, and
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="page" data-page-id="10">
   <p>
    there was loss of motivation and interest, with hypersomnia. In addition to ongoing therapy,
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    was recommended as a tablet of 50 mg daily. Within 10 days the patient said that her mood had lifted, and she was able to feel more focused, more engaged and not so socially “distant”. She doubled her dose of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    to two 50 mg tablets daily just prior to her exams a month later, and described feeling less anxious and more able to cope with her usual examination anxiety. An interesting development on
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    was that the client described feeling less inclined to over-indulge in alcohol. The conclusion was made that while the client had personality problems that required ongoing therapy, the
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    had helped her feel more contained, had lifted her mood, and had also helped with the anxiety.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the third case, the patient presented with Major Depressive Disorder, with symptoms of depressed mood, increased sleep, overeating, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, and thoughts of death. The patient had initially attempted self-medication with a St. John's Wort (
    <i>
     Hypericum perforatum
    </i>
    ) product over the preceding 2 weeks, with minimal effect. The patient was started on
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    , 50 mg in the morning and at lunchtime. On the first day of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    treatment the patients mood felt lifted, and her sleep pattern improved from an excess of 14 h sleep a day to 8 h a day. The patient reported an increase in energy and was able to spontaneously resume her housework. After 6 weeks of treatment with
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    together fully recovered and was maintained.

    7. Concluding comments
   </h1>
   <p>
    Although
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    has so far received the most attention among the
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    species both for research and commercial development, it is clear that other species of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    were certainly utilized in the past, including
    <i>
     Sceletium emarginatum
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     Sceletium expansum
    </i>
    , and
    <i>
     Sceletium strictum
    </i>
    . With further research, these species may also prove to be suitable candidates for product development. It is not y
    <a href="#block-11-0">et a</a>
    pparent what the relative advantage would be of one species over another.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    species have enjoyed a wide range of uses: as masticatory, tea, relief of hunger, thirst, and fatigue, restorative, sedative, hypnotic, analgesic, antispasmodic, and mood-elevator, through to intoxicant. The spectrum of uses are likely to be dose-dependent, with the lowest doses of active alkaloids at the simple masticatory side of the spectrum of uses, and the highest doses at the intoxicating end of the spectrum. It is instructive that elderly rural users of
    <i>
     kougoed
    </i>
    in Namaqualand remove the quid of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    well before any intoxication is experienced, and it is common to re-use the same piece of chewing material as and when they feel like it. This traditional use as a simple masticatory would seem to suggest that very little alkaloid is in fact ingested or absorbed.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    is used as fresh plant material, baked fresh plant material, dried plant material, and dried “fermented” plant material. In some cases the entire plant is used, and in other the roots are first removed. With our present knowledge of the chemistry and biological activities of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    it is not yet clear what the qualitative and quantitative phytochemical differences are between each of these forms of the raw material. Local users do say that the traditionally processed material is more powerful, in terms of intoxication potential, so that this processing may not be necessary for raw material intended for other uses. However we do not yet know what microbiological, enzymatic, or chemical processes occur during the “fermentation” or what affect this traditional processing has on the chemistry or biological activities in the raw product.

   <p>
    Manufactured
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    products have increasingly been appearing on the mark
    <a href="#block-11-0">et a</a>
    s natural supplement for stress, tension, low mood, and for treating anxiety and depression. The
   </p>
   <p>
    products are typically tinctures, tablets or capsule where the unit doses recommended in these products tend to be in the range from 50 to 200 mg of dried milled herbal material.
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    raw material is very variable in total alkaloid content, with the highest values being around 2% of the dry weight. Thus the highest doses of total alkaloid per unit dose of commercial products could be within the range of about 1–4 mg (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Van W</a>

    The well-established history of use of
    <i>
     Scel
     <a href="#block-11-0">et</a>

    </i>
    , extant long-term local use, and increasing use of manufactured
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    products with no known severe adverse effects, suggests that
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    is safe for human consumption. This is further supported by the documented safety in dogs treated with 10 mg/kg
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    given twice daily (
    <a href="#block-11-0">Hirabayashi e</a>

    <a href="#block-11-0">al., 2</a>
    002) and cats treated with 100 mg/kg per day (

    </a>
    and dogs with dementia treated with up to 90 mg/kg per day. (

    </a>
    These doses are far higher than the dose of approximately 1–2 mg/kg per day that humans typically ingest in the form of tablets or capsules. Animal studies (

    indicate potential veterinary applications for
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    , including sedative for cage-stress and travel-stress, and treatment of excessive nocturnal barking in dogs and crying in cats.
   </p>
   <p>
    The
    <i>
     in vitro
    </i>
    activity of mesembrine and related compounds as serotonin-uptake inhibitors provides preliminary pharmacological support for the use of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    in products for stress, anxiety and depression, and may also provide a rationale for the apparent lack of dependence seen with long-term
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    use. The
    <i>
     in vitro
    </i>
    activity of mesembrine as a PDE4 inhibitor is another mechanism whereby
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    may act as an antidepressant, and suggests additional therapeutic potential. The pharmacological study of
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    is still in its infancy, however, and a great deal of work remains to be done. We do not yet know whether these two activities will also be found for other
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    alkaloids, and if so, which compounds will have the most potent and selective activities. While the focus of pharmacological research for over 100 years has been on the alkaloids, the non-alkaloid components have been neglected, and may provide an entirely new field for
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    research.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is hoped that formal placebo-controlled clinical studies on standardised
    <i>
     Sceletium
    </i>
    products will be undertaken to formally establish safety and efficacy, so that the great potential of this plant to assist people living with anxiety and depression and other health conditions can be realized.
