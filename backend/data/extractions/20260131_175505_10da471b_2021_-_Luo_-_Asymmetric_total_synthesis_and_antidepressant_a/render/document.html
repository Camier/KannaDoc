    Asymmetric total synthesis of (–)-sila-mesembranol, the silicon analog of the natural alkaloid (–)-mesembranol has been achieved in 3.3% yield over 11 steps. The chiral silicon center was enantioselectively constructed
    <i>
     via
    </i>
    the asymmetric expansion of a silacyclobutane ring. The synthetic (–)-sila-mesembranol in mice exhibits better antidepressant effects than its carbon counterpart.

    The incorporation of silicon as a carbon isostere into bioactive molecules is an emerging trend in medicinal chemistry,
    <sup>
     1
    </sup>
    and several silicon-containing molecules, such as karenitecin
    <sup>
     2
    </sup>
    and its analogs,
    <sup>
     3
    </sup>
    have been examined in clinical trials.
    <sup>
     11
    </sup>
    The practice has also led to development of antifungal flusilazole
    <sup>
     4
    </sup>
    and pyrethroid insecticide silafluofen,
    <sup>
     5
    </sup>
    which has been commercialized and finds broad application in agriculture. Silicon is attractive for replacing carbon because it shows physicochemical similarities to carbon but also differences that can lead to greater cell penetration, greater bioactivity and lower toxicity (Scheme 1A).
   </p>
   <p>
    Silicon-containing bioactive molecules derived from known carbon analogs or constructed as new compounds
    <sup>
     6
    </sup>
    can be categorized into three types, depending on the stereochemistry of the silicon atom (Scheme 1B). Type I molecules bear an achiral silicon center (“
    <i>
     achiral silicon incorporation
    </i>
    ”), which is located at the terminal or internal position of a chain (karenitecin
    <sup>
     1e
    </sup>
    and sila-Almquist’s inhibitor
    <sup>
     7
    </sup>
    ) or is embedded into a ring framework (sila-hepatitis C virus inhibitor
    <sup>
     8
    </sup>
    ). Types I molecules have been widely studied because their syntheses are practical, as demonstrated by a number of elegant works from Tacke,

    groups.

    </sup>
    Fewer examples of type II molecules have been reported (e.g., sila-haloperidol
    <sup>
     12
    </sup>
    ), which include compounds where a chiral silicon atom is incorporated in a racemic form (“
    <i>
     racemic silicon incorporation

    ”). Type III refers to “
    <i>
     asymmetric silicon incorporation
    </i>
    ”,
    <sup>
     13
    </sup>
    which features a configurationally defined chiral silicon center.
    <sup>
     14
    </sup>
    The asymmetric incorporation of silicon is particularly desirable, as the wide variety of polycyclic natural products and drug molecules bear a stereogenic quaternary carbon center. However, this is much more challenging than incorporation of achiral or racemic silicon center, because only a few methods have been developed for con-

    Therefore, we injected LPS into mice and confirmed depressive behavior based on increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) (Fig. 1A and B). Administration of

    Similarly to the LPS-induced depression model,
    <b>
     4-HOAc
    </b>
    administration (10 mg kg
    <sup>
     -1
    </sup>
    ) alleviated the depressive behavior based on the TST and FST (Fig. 1C and D), but had no effect on autonomic locomotor activity (Fig. 1E and F). This indicates that the observed decrease in immobility time is not because
    <b>
     4-HOAc

    acts as a psychostimulant. Furthermore,
    <b>
     4-HOAc

    did not affect the sucrose preference of chronically stressed mice in the sucrose preference test (Fig. 1G). In addition, we found that
    <b>

    regulates glutamatergic transmission in the anterior cingulate cortex, which may underly its antidepressant effects.

    Conclusions
   </h2>
   <p>
    In this study, we achieved the asymmetric total synthesis of (-)-sila-mesembranol (
    <b>
     4
    </b>
    ), the silicon analog of the natural alkaloid (-)-mesembranol (
    <b>
     1
    </b>
    ). Instead of the traditional achiral or racemic silicon incorporation methods, we achieved the more challenging asymmetric silicon incorporation by replacing the quaternary carbon of
    <b>
     1
    </b>
    and then enantioselectively constructing the chiral silicon center at the ring junction. Our
    <i>
     in vivo
    </i>
    studies found that (-)-sila-mesembranol showed higher activity than its natural analog (-)-mesembranol in two mouse models of depression, suggesting a clinical application potential.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our results clearly show that although asymmetric silicon incorporation is challenging, it can contribute to the synthesis of a wide range of silicon-containing analogues of bioactive carbon-containing molecules, as well as the synthesis of novel structures that cannot be achieved in carbon analogs. In particular, we expect that the synthetic pathway for (-)-sila-mesembranol described here can be used to prepare novel sila-alkaloids bearing the sila-
    <i>
     cis
    </i>
    -3a-aryloctahydroindole core. The carbon version of this core appears in
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    alkaloids, which show promising antidepressant activity. Prompted by these promising results, our future studies will focus on the asymmetric incorporation of silicon into additional quaternary carbon-containing natural products and drugs. Given also that
    <i>
     Sceletium tortuosum
    </i>
    extracts can inhibit serotonin uptake and phosphodiesterase-4 activity
    <i>
     in vitro
    </i>
    ,
    <sup>
     33
    </sup>
    we will further investigate the pharmacological effect of (-)-sila-mesembranol on these processes and proteins.
