It is also an important flavouring agent in commercial food manufacture. This article considers representation of buchu as a traditional remedy in relation to both extensive historical, botanical and commercial interest in the plants and recent and past Khoisan use. The Khoisan account is drawn from detailed ethnographic analysis and fieldwork carried out amongst Namibian Khoisan and northern Cape San. The paper tracks the arrival of buchu onto the European medical market and the subsequent misfit between European and American pharmaceutical representations of the 'true' buchu relative to Khoisan understandings of buchu. I propose that, like the Europeans, the Khoisan have engaged with buchu because of its distinctive odour and properties but, unlike Western appropriators of the plant, Khoisan relationships with buchu relate to smell as an agent of physical and mental transformation. The smell of buchu has been conceived by the Khoisan as a potent force with a role in healing, in perfume use and certain rituals.</p>",

Buchu is characterised by a strong and distinctive smell resultant from the secretion of volatile oils from leaf glands. The smell varies depending on the exact species. Smells range from orange-like to pepperminty and camphoric.</p>",

What I wish to examine is the appropriation of buchu by colonists, travellers, merchants and emergent biomedicine and its subsequent rejection and relegation to the status of a herbal medicine. Surprisingly, despite buchu's historic prominence, its precise identity has shifted over history and remains somewhat elusive. I identify and examine the multiple European and indigenous historical names that appear for buchu in different periods as indicators of tensions in the process of colonial scientific data extraction.</p>",

In particular it has something to add to recent analysis of 'noise' at the coal face of colonial bio-prospecting<sup>2</sup> and anthropological consideration of distinctive indigenous ways of thinking. Buchu history potentially leads to a number of important questions concerning the indigenous and 'Western' boundary of contact over a medicinal plant. A principal issue revolves around how accurately ethnographers of buchu have represented Khoisan ideas and practice over time. This leads in turn to further questions concerning possible similarities and differences in indigenous and biomedical understanding of medical properties and treatments. The contrast between the Euro-American history of buchu and indigenous use and understanding both highlights the partiality of the process of data extraction and draws attention to what seem appropriate ways of thinking about Khoisan relationships with buchu.</p>",

The next section moves chronologically through the introduction of buchu to Europe from the 1700s to the introduction of buchu into the mainstream European medical market place in the early nineteenth century. On the way, I examine settler knowledge of buchu around the same period. A third section engages with questions of 'authentic' buchu as identified by science and commerce and examines how the shape of first European contact with Khoisan has influenced European understanding of buchu. A final section picks up on earlier mentioned Khoisan use of <i>sâi</i> (<i>sā</i>) plants which seem intimately related to buchu and embed buchu knowledge and use in a wider Khoisan cultural context. This section draws heavily on ten months fieldwork carried out in Namibia in 2000 and 2001 and two months amongst the northern Cape San in mid 2006. In particular I examine the Khoisan role of smell in use of buchu and <i>sâi</i> and how this Khoisan understanding differs from European notions of perfume and scientific effectivity.</p>\n",

The Khoisan category encompasses principally perfume and healing balm but also an associated notion of a spiritual and physical sedative and stimulant. The essential understanding of buchu seems to lie in its ability to pacify, awaken, attract and heal. The key to this understanding lies in the ability of smell to bring about physical transformations. Smell, breath, wind and the personal power of people all overlap in Khoisan thought as they do in epistemologies of other indigenous peoples. If a sick or strong smelling, or otherwise 'potent' person stands near someone else, the other person might become sick because of the movement of the essence of the potent person, as smell or wind, into themselves. Buchu smell moves into people and brings about specific effects in accordance with the context of use and what its smell represents to historically and culturally specific Khoisan peoples.</p>\n",

Whilst this may be right, there is little clear evidence to support this claim.<sup>4</sup> The earliest references to buchu appear in the latter half of the seventeenth century and are part of a caucus of knowledge gathered from sailors and travellers familiar with the Cape. European distinction between Hottentots and San was not a regular feature of Khoisan ethnography until Lichtenstein's observations in the early nineteenth century,<sup>5</sup> and even in much later contexts notions of difference have remained controversial.

There is also significant evidence to suggest continuity and stability of Khoisan healing ideas over time.<sup>7</sup> In view of this I examine some of the most influential early references to buchu as a way of providing a background to the details that have repeatedly featured across the colonial ethnography and shaped European understanding of buchu.</p>",

To briefly highlight the wider context of his account, a 1603 reference to Gouarus de Keyser stands as the first record of a plant collector at the Cape. The earliest mention of a Cape plant concerns the seaweed <i>Ecklonia maxima</i> and the first Cape plant conveyed to Europe was <i>Protea nerifolia</i>, in 1605. By the later seventeenth century Cape plants were already featuring in European botanical collections, including that of Paul Hermann (1646–1695), a German medic and later director of the botanic gardens at Leiden.<sup>8</sup></p>",

Details of the customs of the visiting Hottentots were recorded by Dapper's correspondent in the van Riebeeck administration.<sup>9</sup> Regardless, however, of the exact origin of Dapper's source, buchu only begins to regularly appear in European accounts in the second half of the seventeenth century. Concerning buchu, Dapper simply noted that Hottentot women strewed 'boggoa' over their heads.<sup>10</sup> Shortly after Dapper, Ten Rhyne (1686), a Dutch physician of the East India Company, recounted details gleaned from a stopover at the Cape on the way to the East Indies, including that Hottentots smeared themselves with oil and animal fat and their heads with the ash of 'bouchou'. This is one of the earliest references to buchu being smeared on the body alongside sheep fat.<sup>11</sup></p>",

Kolb's subsequent account has been highly influential to the writing of Khoekhoe history. It was, he claimed, based on years of contact with different Hottentot groups. Unfortunately, following the ethnographic conventions of his day, he left no account of his travel details and hence the provenance of his contacts. Kolb's contribution to colonial familiarity with buchu is twofold. Firstly, he popularised an early scientific name for buchu, <i>Spiraea Africana odorata, folis pilosis</i>, which was the name attributed to buchu around 1692 by Oldenland, one time master gardener at the Dutch East India Company Gardens at the Cape settlement.<sup>14</sup> Secondly, he provides us with more than just passing reference to Hottentot buchu use. In one instance he related an operation in which a testicle was removed and the empty testicular sack was stuffed with a mixture of sheep's fat and powdered 'salutary herbs, particularly the Buchu'.<sup>15</sup> In another, Kolb recorded that when a Hottentot was seized with pain the physician took the caul of a sacrificed sheep and, 'having powdered it with Buchu, twists it in the manner of a rope, and hangs it about the patients neck' saying, 'You will be better now ...'.<sup>16</sup> Kolb additionally observed that newborn babies were smeared with sheep's fat or melted butter which was allowed to soak into the child's pores. Once dried the baby was powdered in buchu from head to foot to form a crust.<sup>17</sup></p>\n",

There is the normative assumption that healing and perfume are words and ideas that can be used interchangeably not only through history but across cultural divides. As indicated in the above examples, whilst buchu clearly does have a role in healing people, this is not quite the same healing known to biomedicine. Despite some formal resemblance between Khoisan and Western uses of perfume, poultices, oral herbal remedies and ointments – antibiotic or otherwise, there remain fundamental differences or tensions in the understanding of cause, effect and desired outcome. If the understanding of illness, how it is caused, spread and healed is different there is historical slippage in justifying parity of current European medical use with past Khoisan use.

Given the relatively shallow nature of ethnography and travel accounts that characterise colonialism well into the nineteenth century, it is perhaps not surprising that details of buchu use are not extensive. There is, however, enough information to at least begin to reflect upon historical Khoisan as opposed to colonial notions of buchu. In the absence of an indigenous historical literary account, a locally informed reading back that draws on what interdisciplinary evidence there is, including linguistic, archaeological, historical and anthropological, remains the only option. One factor that helps historical and recent understanding of buchu use is an overlapping history of references, starting with Kolb, to ‘Saab’, sā or sāi plants which point to buchu not being so much a distinct species, but an indigenous relationship with certain sorts of plants in certain sorts of ritual and healing contexts. I return to this issue in the latter section of the paper.</p>",

That the picture might be more complex is suggested by the internal healing power of buchu and fat evinced in Kolb’s testicle packing account, in buchu use for poisoned arrow wounds and for headaches and inward ailments. The key to understanding these multiple contexts of buchu use, which I explore later, lies in the transformation of personal attributes. The use of buchu with or without fat confers powers or attraction between a person and the wider world and, depending on the context, brings healing or other potency.</p>",

How buchu used in an ostrich feather trap might relate to perfume use, begins to make sense if we think in terms of connections between hunters and animals. Buchu on the feathers may have served to transform or disguise the nature of the trap or to attract or reassure potential animal victims. On the skull, buchu might have been a ritual means of opening a channel between the dead and the living, catalysing the dead into vital participation, although this latter point in particular must remain purely speculative. The phenomenon of rubbing buchu under the noses of participants in a healing session is a feature of recently observed Bushmen dances. In this context, and probably similarly in Gordon’s encounter, the buchu is said to ‘open people’ up. Rubbing buchu on those gathered at healing dances makes them receptive to healing forces and serves as a mechanism of ritual binding.</p>",

He commented that Hottentots and Boers had long used buchu as medicine in vinegar form or alternatively infused in brandy. The early ethnography suggests that such settler medical knowledge of buchu came out of a wider context of familiarity. Buchu was a part of pragmatic fat application to protect the body from the elements. It was also a 'salutary herb' and one of a number of herbal remedies used by Hottentots who were often thought skilled in such matters. At the same time though, buchu was also an element in superstitious rituals observed amongst Hottentot savages. Despite these multiple identities</p>\n",

Smith identifies a wide range of buchu plants known to nineteenth century Afrikaaner settlers. Given the prolonged use of buchu by this time, it is highly likely that many of these names reflect earlier settler familiarity. Amongst many examples Smith includes <i>boegoe-Ankerkaroo</i>, <i>boegebossie</i> and <i>boegeokapok</i>. Smith distinguishes a difference between names indicative of pleasing or medicinal qualities, such as <i>anysboegoe</i> and <i>goeieboegoe</i> and those considered unpleasant, including <i>bitterboegoe</i> and <i>knoffelboegoe</i>. This application of the word <i>boegoe</i> as suffix or prefix to very different plants might be thought to indicate an Afrikaans tendency to use 'buchu' in a loose generic sense for plants that smell similar or are notable for their smell. Although buchu plants are predominantly smelly this is not, however, always the case. In 1854 Moffat recorded that Doornbergen Bushmen and Bastars used non-aromatic plants, <i>haasboegoe</i> and <i>wolfboegoe</i>, mixed with fat, as a 'cooling substance' for smearing on their cheeks.<sup>42</sup> This link between plants used by Bushmen and Bastars in indigenous 'cooling' contexts with plants labelled 'boegoe' by colonists, suggests that settler principals of naming may be a good reflection of indigenous use and not a purely Afrikaaner naming process based on ideas of similarly smelly plants. This link between buchu plants and plants used in certain indigenous contexts, as opposed to buchu being plants of a specific species, is born out in the ethnography of sā plants.</p>\n",

By 1826 Lord Somerset, Governor of the Cape, observed that the medical demand for 'Boekhoo' was potentially of great benefit to the interests of the Cape Colony, but to meet the possible demand the plant must be protected.<sup>49</sup> Further demonstrating the contemporaneous popularity of buchu an anonymous note in the Cape <i>Commercial Advertiser</i>, 1827, reveals that Moravian missionaries at Genadendal sent <i>Diosma crenata</i> leaves to Madras and Calcutta, recommending them on the basis that local Hottentots used them as a remedy for intestinal colic pains.<sup>50</sup> Further testament of the growing prominence and economic profile of buchu is its inclusion in Dr Pappe's <i>Florae Capensis Medicae Prodromus</i> which was an expanded commentary of the plants displayed by a South African drug company at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851. Pappe's account of <i>D. crenata</i> identifies the active principal of buchu as the aromatic oil 'Diosmin' which has 'a particular smell, and a slightly astringent, bitter, taste'. This focus on Diosmin followed earlier pharmaceutical interest in buchu as indicated by research published in the <i>Archiv der Pharmazie</i> 1826. In England the <i>Penny Cyclopaedia</i> (1837) attributed pharmaceutical analysis of the leaves to 'Cadet de Gassecourt' and specified that 'Brandes considers the extractive to be peculiar and terms it Diosmin'.<sup>51</sup> As Pappe's notes on buchu suggest, the range of ailments supposedly amenable to buchu treatment rose incrementally with the profile of the drug. In addition to the maladies previously mentioned, Pappe noted buchu had been prescribed for cholera morbus.<sup>52</sup></p>",

H.T. Helmhold, a retail druggist based in Philadelphia and New York, was a thrusting business man with big ideas. Although he was declared bankrupt by 1872, his 'Extract' continued to be manufactured by his brother for a number of years. In 1869, 1870 and 1871 he purportedly spent $500,000, in each year, on buchu marketing and at one stage his income from buchu was estimated around a million dollars per annum. His 'Extract' advertisements appeared across North America, in Europe and Asia, on sites ranging from inaccessible looking Rocky Mountain faces to the pyramids of Egypt. The label on his product claimed use of the fluid, as 'an invaluable remedy' used by 'the United States army, and in all the state hospitals and public sanitary institutions, as well as in private practice'.<sup>53</sup> In 1878 Helmhold revealed</p>",

The evidence clearly reveals the fallacy of these assumptions. The predominance of <i>A. betulina</i> is contingent upon European identification of efficacy. This is immediately evident when we recognise that the earliest professional botanical evidence, from Thunberg, pronounced <i>D. pulchella</i> over <i>D. betulina</i>. Focussing on <i>A. betulina</i> draws attention away from the different phases and inconsistencies of European understanding. It also suggests that real Khoisan usage should be fixed at some time and at some place, around the south western Cape, where Europeans first encountered Hottentots.</p>\n",

Burchell may have encouraged this situation with his suggestion that ‘in the countries lying beyond the geographical boundary of that genus [<i>Diosma</i>], other plants of various genera are, of necessity, made use of’.<sup>99</sup> ‘Of necessity’ suggests hardship in the absence of better quality or more suitable alternatives.

This is interesting because it conflates first European arrival at the Cape with discovery of a Khoisan population who subsequently, through their primacy of 'discovery', are promoted in history as somehow original Khoisan. This has led to an often implicit ethnographic message that buchu is principally a Cape phenomenon and in its 'correct' Cape manifestation relates to <i>A. betulina</i> and any use of non <i>betulina</i> plants beyond the Cape is somehow shadowy and less pure knowledge. The implied usage of less effective plants must, however, be recognised as a result of European bioscience having privileged the scientific effective properties of <i>A. betulina</i>.</p>\n",

In 1777 Gordon observed that the 'Geissiqua people [...] sat pounding red buchu from camel-thorn bark'.<sup>101</sup> This again suggests that beyond the southern Cape non 'buchu' plants had a role as buchu. Certainly in recent contexts the term buchu is used by Khoisan at least as far north as Namibia's Walvis Bay and is not tied to plants of the southern Cape. My fieldwork indicates that Khoisan from the northern Cape upwards use plants known as sâi (or sâ) in a category of practice that compounds ritual, healing and perfume and overlaps with the way buchu is and has been used elsewhere. These plants have a long history of use. Buchu seems therefore to be a southern Cape variant of the broader buchu/sâi cultural phenomenon. Earlier ethnographers equally seem to have recognised overlaps between buchu and sâi.</p>\n",

A healer told Lee that, ‘You feel your blood become very hot just like blood boiling on a fire and then you start to heal’. Lee notes that <i>n/um</i>, to boil, is related to boiling of water and ripening of plants. He proposes that there is a symbolic association between still cool water that boils and activating medicine and plants which are dormant ‘becoming nutritionally potent when ripe’. He sees this notion extended in joking metaphor to nubile maidens who have reached menarche and are considered “‘ripe” for intercourse and impregnation’.<sup>121</sup></p>\n",

Khoisan understandings of smell sit in a web of relationships linking wind, breath, smell and even arrows. Each person and certain potent animals are envisaged as possessing their own specific winds. A person's wind represents their identity and their power to act in a particular manner in the world, bringing about particular results. The notion of wind crosses over with notions of spirit helpers that inhabit Khoisan. Many Namibian Khoisan refer to these as <i>/gais (b)</i> or <i>gais</i>. If one has the wind of the mamba or the mamba <i>gais</i>, there is something of the mamba inside you. If you see a mamba it will not harm you because it will recognise one of its own. I was told if such a person sees a mamba they must say, 'I am one of you, do not harm me' and the mamba will let them pass. Similarly Khoisan healers have long been noted for addressing storms and rain in a personal manner, saying 'do not harm me, I am one of you'.

Breath is a gift from the divine that both gives life and demonstrates life. It is a vital force that holds the identity and hence potency of a person. Many Khoisan believe the potency, and in some sense breath, is held in the heart. Often the lungs and heart are envisaged as interrelated wind holding organs. That bad thoughts can be expelled harmfully from the heart in the wind of words, or that to lose one's heart is to lose life, are both common Khoisan beliefs founded in deeper notions of wind. The wind of people and organisms and the wind that blows, holds people together in an existentially self evident mesh of revealing relationships.</p>",

But in a commercial context 'Western' scientific knowledge of buchu transformed the commonality of the experience and knowledge of buchu. For Khoisan, medical uses of buchu were and in some cases still are, occasions of personal transformation. 'Treatment' is founded in a way of knowing still firmly rooted in notions of smell and potency. In contrast to this, scientific and commercial users of buchu applied a scientific or pseudo-scientific rationale to the apparent efficacy identified in some Khoisan practices and extended the range of buchu uses enormously. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, preparations of buchu included tinctures, elixirs and fluid extracts. These remedies were indicated for some diseases that Khoisan might have recognised but understood in an entirely different manner.</p>",

Closer consideration of what perfume means in European contexts – a powerful scent, still often derived from animal parts, that through pheromonal action operates in a biologically and socially potent manner – brings us closer to Khoisan understanding of buchu. However, to really begin to appreciate Khoisan buchu use, one has to turn to the details of Khoisan life as a culturally rich people with continuing close ties to a rural African environment. Trying to pin down whether buchu or sâi refers to particular plant species, a role for particular plants or even the gathering process of powerful plants opens up the cracks in representation of Khoisan.</p>\n",

Barnard, <i>Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 7. I use 'Khoisan' as opposed to 'Khoesân' as it remains more readily recognised. Aware of the pejorative nature of the word 'Hottentot', I use 'Hottentot' for historical accuracy, as a simple replacement with Khoekhoe would misrepresent the complexity of the material. In my experience only the most politicised Bushmen insist on being called 'San'. The vast majority I have encountered prefer to be known as 'Bushmen'. This may or may not represent repossession of the word. I use San and Bushmen interchangeably.</p>\n",
