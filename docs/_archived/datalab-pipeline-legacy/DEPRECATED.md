# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Legacy Documentation

**Archived**: 2026-02-05

This documentation is outdated:
- References Gemini (now using GLM-4.7/DeepSeek)
- References old paths (prod_max, DataLab/ALL_FLAT)
- Entity extraction schema changed to V3.1

## Current Documentation
- **Entity Extraction**: `backend/lib/entity_extraction/AGENTS.md`
- **DataLab Library**: `backend/lib/datalab/AGENTS.md`
- **Main Docs**: `AGENTS.md` (project root)

## Why Archived
These docs were created during initial DataLab integration and have not been updated
to reflect the V3.1 schema migration and provider changes.
